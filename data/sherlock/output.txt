     "Good-evening, Mr. James Windibank," said Holmes. "I think that this

     "Madam, what you ask me is really impossible."

     "And I am the witness?"

     Sherlock Holmes picked them up one by one, and laid them along the

     Lestrade looked sadly at my companion. Then he turned to me, tapped
     his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

     He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his

     "There is only one point on which I should like a little more
     past it.

     "No data yet," he answered. "It is a capital mistake to theorize
     before you have all the evidence. It biases the judgment."

     crippled wretch standing by the lamp-post and shaking his clenched
     fists in the air as if he were mad with rage.  She never said a word
     until we were at the door here, when she took me by the hand and
     begged me to tell no one what had happened.

     "'"It's an old acquaintance of mine who has come down in the world,"
     said she.  When I promised her I would say nothing she kissed me, and
     I have never seen her since.  I have told you now the whole truth,
     and if I withheld it from the police it is because I did not realize

     "No."

     "No."

     "Well, you will be surprised to hear that there is no stain on the
     white woodwork to correspond."

     "Ah!" She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are

     could easily see that Holmes was in a state of suppressed excitement,
     in their minds, and argue from them that something will come to pass.

     "No."

     "Was any other bicycle missing?"

     "No, sir."





          CHAPTER II
     I rose somewhat earlier than usual, and found that Sherlock Holmes

     distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he
     reentered the building to save property, after the local fire brigade
     had given it up as impossible. Thus it came about that John Douglas
     of the Manor House had within five years won himself quite a
     reputation in Birlstone.

     "Then mother's a deader too," cried the little girl dropping her face

     Now, then, give him the pencil.  You are to ask the questions, Mr.
     Melas, and he will write the answers.  Ask him first of all whether
     first, and how long I had to wait before I succeeded in making any
     headway.

     "But the Solar System!" I protested.

     "What the deuce is it to me?" he interrupted impatiently; "you say
     that we go round the sun. If we went round the moon it would not make
     a pennyworth of difference to me or to my work."

     I was on the point of asking him what that work might be, but
     something in his manner showed me that the question would be an
     them:--

     "You had better stay here, Watson."

     "Why?"

     "You have been very remiss in not coming to me sooner," said he,
     time to look out for squalls when we do. We have a clear month before
     topic of conversation through the length and breadth of England. For
     to us. At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden box, the

     sent a brother medico to us at such an hour, I followed Holmes into
     far-fetched an inference that the V. V. upon the card by the dead
     body might stand for Vermissa Valley, or that this very valley which
     sends forth emissaries of murder may be that Valley of Fear of which
     we have heard. So much is fairly clear. And now, Mr. Barker, I seem
     perceive his annoyance. Such was the third person who was one of the
     that of an artist rather than of a surgeon. His dress was quiet and
     sombre--a black frock-coat, dark trousers, and a touch of color about
     the shot."

     "Exactly."

     "Then, pray, sit down, and let us hear it for there are several
     points on which I must confess that I am still in the dark."

     Without a word Holmes hurried to a carriage, and during the long
     waiting-room, naturally thought that the consultation had come to an

          CHAPTER V
          John Ferrier Talks With The Prophet


     Three weeks had passed since Jefferson Hope and his comrades had
     departed from Salt Lake City. John Ferrier's heart was sore within
     him when he thought of the young man's return, and of the impending
     loss of his adopted child. Yet her bright and happy face reconciled
     him to the arrangement more than any argument could have done. He had
     always determined, deep down in his resolute heart, that nothing
     would ever induce him to allow his daughter to wed a Mormon. Such a
     marriage he regarded as no marriage at all, but as a shame and a
     disgrace. Whatever he might think of the Mormon doctrines, upon that
     one point he was inflexible. He had to seal his mouth on the subject,
     however, for to express an unorthodox opinion was a dangerous matter
     in those days in the Land of the Saints.

     Yes, a dangerous matter--so dangerous that even the most saintly

     experiment even for one's self, and doubly so for a friend. I am
     disturbed?"








          CHAPTER I
          Mr. Sherlock Holmes


     It was one o'clock when we left No. 3, Lauriston Gardens. Sherlock
     Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a
     long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take
     us to the address given us by Lestrade.

     "Just let us hear it all in your own way as it occurred."

     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     very leniently dealt with."

     "Exactly. But he received it on that day?"

     "Yes."

     "Nay, madam, there again you ask me more than I can possibly answer."

     A couple of days later Major Sholto was strolling on the beach: so I
     took the chance of speaking to him.

     "I observed it as you entered the room," said Holmes.

     "Well, you know, after a crime of this sort we are very careful to
     your seat and let me know how I can serve you."

     companion shook his head and shrugged his shoulders.

     "I am."

     "You will have your data soon," I remarked, pointing with my finger;
     hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to have quite
     the influence of some powerful drug, and as no sense could be got out

     "Quite so. I have a kind of intuition that way. Now and again a case
     Holmes led me to the nearest telegraph office, whence he dispatched a
     long telegram. He then hailed a cab, and ordered the driver to take
     us to the address given us by Lestrade.

     "And so did I," said Baskerville. "Every inch of it."

     "Well, well, we score over you for once, Mr. Holmes. You must give us
     best this time." He struck his stick sharply upon the ground, on
     at liberty to preserve your secret, but you must promise me that

     have here a watch which has recently come into my possession. Would
     "Quite so."

     "You mean the retired sergeant of Marines," said Sherlock Holmes.

     "Brag and bounce!" thought I to myself. "He knows that I cannot
     companion.

     "No, sir."

     "I said, sir, to the precisely scientific mind. But as a practical
     may be in safety. And yet you cannot guard yourself too closely."

     Holmes stretched out his hand for the manuscript and flattened it
     upon his knee.

     "Never mind," said he, chuckling to himself. "The question now is
     we did as we walk. First of all, we saw the body of this unfortunate
     man. He certainly died from a revolver wound as reported."

     "And your name is--?"

     "I had every reason to suppose that this Abe Slaney was an American,
     of the wagonette. The figure of a woman was silhouetted against the
     yellow light of the hall. She came out and helped the man to hand

     north, and there met by Captain Peter Carey's ship. If that were so,
     though she, with the keen eye of love, saw plainly that he was ill at
     that, but the dad came to me next day and asked me whether I would
     ease.

     The man looked surprised and a little embarrassed. "Why, there's no
     He wanted to know the object of my inquiries, but I managed to
     at Pondicherry Lodge in Upper Norwood. He had prospered in India, and
     brought back with him a considerable sum of money, a large collection
     of valuable curiosities, and a staff of native servants. With these
     early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were
     his openly expressed desire that the whole country-side should,
     west I had no idea. For that matter, Reading, and possibly other
     seeing it among the articles found. His eye, of course, would light
     upon this. He would be overjoyed. Why should he fear a trap? There
     smiling expression and showy dress were in strange contrast with the
     the sob of a woman, the muffled, strangling gasp of one who is torn
     bars of light,--sad faces and glad, haggard and merry. Like all human
     kind, they flitted from the gloom into the light, and so back into
     have personal reasons for bewailing his untimely end. His generous
     chamber which had struck such a gloom into our souls upon the evening
     and there was much to be done.

     His remarks were suddenly cut short by a loud hubbub which broke out
     from the stall which we had just left. Turning round we saw a little
     drive, so we took a gray view of the place. Now we are fresh and
     well, so it is all cheerful once more."

     "No, sir, we hain't," said one of the youths.

     Von Bork shook his head. "I don't see how that could be. There is a
     paper this morning immediately after the affair."

     We were all astonished by the appearance of the apartment into which
     he invited us. In that sorry house it looked as out of place as a
     Watson, we have ended by turning the dancing men to good when they
     hand in the bag. No doubt it had been prearranged in some fashion,
     door, and revealed to the astonished farmer the fierce face and
     and that she still remains a widow, devoting her whole life to the
     care of the poor and to the administration of her husband's estate.





          CHAPTER IV
          The Story of the Bald-Headed Man

     "Any news, Inspector?"

     "Well, we have seen some very interesting things. I'll tell you what
     found that there was method in his madness."

     "'Breckinridge, of Covent Garden.'

     "Yes."

     "Certainly."

     "I ought to make you sign a paper to that effect."

     "Yes."

     "And it arrived very speedily?"

     "Nor should I, but we are bound to take every possibility into
     Colonel.

     "There's more work to be got out of one of those little beggars than
     We then had an interview with Mr. Cunningham and his son, who were
     wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. "If you will be
     good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o'clock I should
     very angry with me for taking the course which has seemed right to
     the door-mat. In that way I didn't know much of what was going on
     was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil, with a
     gun and treat himself to little shooting trips. And all this with
     drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her."

     She had slipped unseen through the yard-entrance and passed behind
     two or three small craft, so that she had fairly got her speed up
     before we saw her. Now she was flying down the stream, near in to the
     shore, going at a tremendous rate. Jones looked gravely at her and
     shook his head.

     "On May 1st the boy arrived, that being the beginning of the summer
     term. He was a charming youth, and he soon fell into our ways. I may
     apparently neither the better nor the worse for its draught.

     the place disarranged, and missed the things which he had taken?"

     "Some inquiries are offensive," Barker answered angrily.

     "None."

     "I will not attempt it."

     "None."

     "No, sir."

     "How's that, then?"

     "Yes."

     "'16 Ivy Lane, Brixton,' he answered. 'But don't let yourself be
     such an investigation."

     "I should like to have a glance round. What a charming, old-fashioned
     room! Perhaps you will kindly wait a minute until I have examined the
     and inspected that also. The bed, the carpet, the chairs the
     back my eye caught the pellet of paper which the prisoner had tossed

     "His face--his dress--didn't you notice them?" Holmes broke in

     "Then it comes to this," said the sergeant: "If anyone came from

          CHAPTER III


          CHAPTER III


     Sherlock Holmes took his bottle from the corner of the mantelpiece
     during the last eight years studied the methods of my friend Sherlock

     "They use none. There is a stove. The bell-rope hangs from the wire

     up a magazine from the table and attempted to while away the time
     with it, while my companion munched silently at his toast. One of the
     character from the time that he passed the moor-gate, and that he
     was no trace of love between us any longer. I could see that she

     "Pile it on, men, pile it on!" cried Holmes, looking down into the
     engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,
     aquiline face. "Get every pound of steam you can."

     "I think we gain a little," said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.

     "I am sure of it," said I. "We shall be up with her in a very few
     greatest consternation by the strange and painful episodes which have
     same with his badge upon the forearm."

     "Douglas!" he stammered. "Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man,
     it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
     get those names?"

     "Where, then, is my wife?"

     "Another five minutes, Mr. Holmes, and I should have wormed out the
     whole story under their very noses.  My very next question might have
     cleared the matter up, but at that instant the door opened and a
     woman stepped into the room.  I could not see her clearly enough to
     know more than that she was tall and graceful, with black hair, and
     clad in some sort of loose white gown.

     "'Harold,' said she, speaking English with a broken accent.  'I could
     not stay away longer.  It is so lonely up there with only--Oh, my
     God, it is Paul!'

     "These last words were in Greek, and at the same instant the man with
     a convulsive effort tore the plaster from his lips, and screaming out
     'Sophy!  Sophy!' rushed into the woman's arms.  Their embrace was but
     for an instant, however, for the younger man seized the woman and
     pushed her out of the room, while the elder easily overpowered his
     emaciated victim, and dragged him away through the other door.  For a
     moment I was left alone in the room, and I sprang to my feet with
     some vague idea that I might in some way get a clue to what this
     house was in which I found myself.  Fortunately, however, I took no
     that," he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be
     "Yes."

     "'That will do, Mr. Melas,' said he.  'You perceive that we have
     taken you into our confidence over some very private business.  We
     should not have troubled you, only that our friend who speaks Greek
     and who began these negotiations has been forced to return to the
     East.  It was quite necessary for us to find some one to take his
     place, and we were fortunate in hearing of your powers.'

     "I bowed.

     "'There are five sovereigns here,' said he, walking up to me, 'which
     will, I hope, be a sufficient fee.  But remember,' he added, tapping
     me lightly on the chest and giggling, 'if you speak to a human soul
     about this--one human soul, mind--well, may God have mercy upon your
     soul!'

     "I cannot tell you the loathing and horror with which this
     insignificant-looking man inspired me.  I could see him better now as
     the lamp-light shone upon him.  His features were peaky and sallow,
     and his little pointed beard was thready and ill-nourished.  He
     pushed his face forward as he spoke and his lips and eyelids were
     continually twitching like a man with St. Vitus's dance.  I could not
     help thinking that his strange, catchy little laugh was also a
     symptom of some nervous malady.  The terror of his face lay in his
     eyes, however, steel gray, and glistening coldly with a malignant,
     inexorable cruelty in their depths.

     "'We shall know if you speak of this,' said he.  'We have our own
     means of information.  Now you will find the carriage waiting, and my
     friend will see you on your way.'

     "I was hurried through the hall and into the vehicle, again obtaining
     that momentary glimpse of trees and a garden.  Mr. Latimer followed
     closely at my heels, and took his place opposite to me without a
     word.  In silence we again drove for an interminable distance with
     the windows raised, until at last, just after midnight, the carriage
     pulled up.

     "'You will get down here, Mr. Melas,' said my companion.  'I am sorry
     to leave you so far from your house, but there is no alternative. 
     Any attempt upon your part to follow the carriage can only end in
     injury to yourself.'

     "He opened the door as he spoke, and I had hardly time to spring out
     when the coachman lashed the horse and the carriage rattled away.  I
     looked around me in astonishment.  I was on some sort of a heathy
     common mottled over with dark clumps of furze-bushes.  Far away
     stretched a line of houses, with a light here and there in the upper
     windows.  On the other side I saw the red signal-lamps of a railway.

     "'You are looking for a situation, miss?' he asked.

     "Anybody supplying any information as to the whereabouts of a Greek
     gentleman named Paul Kratides, from Athens, who is unable to speak
     English, will be rewarded.  A similar reward paid to any one giving
     information about a Greek lady whose first name is Sophy. X 2473.

     "That was in all the dailies.  No answer."

     "How about the Greek Legation?"

     "I have inquired.  They know nothing."

     "A wire to the head of the Athens police, then?"

     "Sherlock has all the energy of the family," said Mycroft, turning to
     me.  "Well, you take the case up by all means, and let me know if you
     do any good."

     "Certainly," answered my friend, rising from his chair.  "I'll let
     you know, and Mr. Melas also.  In the meantime, Mr. Melas, I should
     certainly be on my guard, if I were you, for of course they must know
     through these advertisements that you have betrayed them."

     As we walked home together, Holmes stopped at a telegraph office and
     sent off several wires.

     "You see, Watson," he remarked, "our evening has been by no means
     wasted.  Some of my most interesting cases have come to me in this
     to do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last
     although it can admit of but one explanation, has still some
     distinguishing features."

     "You have hopes of solving it?"

     "Well, knowing as much as we do, it will be singular indeed if we
     fail to discover the rest.  You must yourself have formed some theory
     which will explain the facts to which we have listened."

     "In a vague way, yes."

     "What was your idea, then?"

     "It seemed to me to be obvious that this Greek girl had been carried
     off by the young Englishman named Harold Latimer."

     "Carried off from where?"

     "Athens, perhaps."

     Sherlock Holmes shook his head.  "This young man could not talk a
     word of Greek.  The lady could talk English fairly well. 
     Inference--that she had been in England some little time, but he had
     not been in Greece."

     "Well, then, we will presume that she had come on a visit to England,
     and that this Harold had persuaded her to fly with him."

     "That is more probable."

     "I can drive you," said Lestrade.

     "You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that
     "And yet one would have expected some bleeding. Would it be possible
     the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of
     Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a
     radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered
     you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good
     years in the force, but this really takes the cake."

     "It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
     take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty, sir, to
     in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?"

     "How can you say that?"

     "Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who
     lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing
     that, I suppose,' said he. "This is worse than death, for it means
     me."

     "The manageress had sat all this while busy with her papers without a
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I

     carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.

     "There has been some new development?"

     Mycroft picked up the Daily News, which was lying on the side-table.

     "Anybody supplying any information as to the whereabouts of a Greek
     gentleman named Paul Kratides, from Athens, who is unable to speak
     English, will be rewarded.  A similar reward paid to any one giving
     information about a Greek lady whose first name is Sophy. X 2473.
     When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes's movements were
     such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean white
     cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he placed his
     newly-acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. Finally, he picked up
     his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the
     head. The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over
     the shattered remains. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he
     held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a
     plum in a pudding.

     One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped
     convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he
     has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely
     householders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his
     flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard
     of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon
     the moor during all that time. Of course, so far as his concealment
     goes there is no difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would
     give him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were
     to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore,
     that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in
     consequence.

     We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take
     face, but very pleasant in his ways, for he was laughing all the time
     that he was talking."

     "Come along!" cried Sherlock Holmes, abruptly.  "This grows serious,"
     he observed, as we drove to Scotland Yard.  "These men have got hold
     of Melas again.  He is a man of no physical courage, as they are well
     aware from their experience the other night.  This villain was able
     to terrorize him the instant that he got into his presence.  No doubt
     they want his professional services, but, having used him, they may
     be inclined to punish him for what they will regard as his
     treachery."

     Our hope was that, by taking train, we might get to Beckenham as soon
     or sooner than the carriage.  On reaching Scotland Yard, however, it
     was more than an hour before we could get Inspector Gregson and
     comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the
     house.  It was a quarter to ten before we reached London Bridge, and
     half past before the four of us alighted on the Beckenham platform. 
     A drive of half a mile brought us to The Myrtles--a large, dark house
     standing back from the road in its own grounds.  Here we dismissed
     our cab, and made our way up the drive together.

     "The windows are all dark," remarked the inspector.  "The house seems
     deserted."

     "Our birds are flown and the nest empty," said Holmes.

     "Why do you say so?"

     "I don't know, sir," answered the woman who had opened the door; "I
     Devine's Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one
     before I take ten pounds from you."

     "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked
     Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

     "You may have observed the same wheel-tracks going the other way. 
     But the outward-bound ones were very much deeper--so much so that we
     can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable weight on
     the carriage."

     face froze the attention of the audience. There was a dead hush of
     and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the
     trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the
     effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted
     by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in
     a blanched cheek.  He had been taken swiftly to Beckenham, and had
     heard the word David uttered twice by the lady.  The point is of the
     utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden
     quarrel.  The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.

          CHAPTER VI
          A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.


     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious
     face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten
     appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
     would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the house,
     from his own talk and that of his wife that he had spent a part of
     the room.

     "The public," it said, "have lost a sensational treat through the

     account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you
     do I hope that I may be of use to you.  I think I can prove that the
     poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached

     subject; but the police had discovered that these same busts might

     this class of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. To all this
     information, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with
     polite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see that
     his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of mingled
     uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to
     assume. At last he started in his chair and his eyes brightened.
     There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we heard steps upon
     the stairs, and an elderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers

          On The Great Alkali Plain


     In the central portion of the great North American Continent there
     lies an arid and repulsive desert, which for many a long year served
     as a barrier against the advance of civilisation. From the Sierra
     Nevada to Nebraska, and from the Yellowstone River in the north to
     the Colorado upon the south, is a region of desolation and silence.
     Nor is Nature always in one mood throughout this grim district. It
     comprises snow-capped and lofty mountains, and dark and gloomy
     valleys. There are swift-flowing rivers which dash through jagged

     Holmes glanced at me and raised his eyebrows sardonically. "With two
     for that. You see it all exactly as I found it."


     I confess at these words a shudder passed through me. There was a
     thrill in the doctor's voice which showed that he was himself deeply
     moved by that which he told us. Holmes leaned forward in his
     the evenings--I put the thing clear out of my head. I never dreamed

     "Ha! What did he say?"

     "If this man was murdered, how was it done?" asked the former.

     "'It rings true, eh?' said he. 'It's good enough to act upon?'

     "By no means."

     "'There are no other elms?'

     "He has a cup of tea taken in to him early every morning. When the
     maid entered, about seven, there the unfortunate fellow was hanging
     in the middle of the room. He had tied his cord to the hook on which
     the heavy lamp used to hang, and he had jumped off from the top of
     the very box that he showed us yesterday."

     Holmes stood for a moment in deep thought.

     "With your permission," said he at last, "I should like to go
     upstairs and look into the matter."

     We both ascended, followed by the doctor.

     It was a dreadful sight which met us as we entered the bedroom door.
     I have spoken of the impression of flabbiness which this man
     Blessington conveyed. As he dangled from the hook it was exaggerated
     and intensified until he was scarce human in his appearance. The neck
     was drawn out like a plucked chicken's, making the rest of him seem
     the more obese and unnatural by the contrast. He was clad only in his
     long night-dress, and his swollen ankles and ungainly feet protruded
     starkly from beneath it. Beside him stood a smart-looking
     police-inspector, who was taking notes in a pocket-book.

     "Ah, Mr. Holmes," said he, heartily, as my friend entered, "I am
     delighted to see you."

     "Good-morning, Lanner," answered Holmes; "you won't think me an
     intruder, I am sure. Have you heard of the events which led up to
     this affair?"

     "Then let us go to arrest him."

     "You can take him to the mortuary now," he said. "There is nothing

     from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred
     difficulties that perplex him.

     "That is very helpful, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right. Wonderful!
     Wonderful! Do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world

     dates. Least of all does the maiden herself know it until the tone of
     a voice or the touch of a hand sets her heart thrilling within her,
     little past the hour."

     I picked up my hat and my heaviest stick, but I observed that Holmes
     took his revolver from his drawer and slipped it into his pocket. It
     was clear that he thought that our night's work might be a serious
     one.

     Miss Morstan was muffled in a dark cloak, and her sensitive face was

     however, he would seldom produce any music or attempt any recognized

     eyes and scrape carelessly at the fiddle which was thrown across his
     knee. Sometimes the chords were sonorous and melancholy. Occasionally
     they were fantastic and cheerful. Clearly they reflected the thoughts
     which possessed him, but whether the music aided those thoughts, or
     irresistibly reminded of a pure-blooded well-trained foxhound as it

     Our morning's exertions had been too much for my weak health, and I
     was tired out in the afternoon. After Holmes' departure for the
     concert, I lay down upon the sofa and endeavoured to get a couple of
     hours' sleep. It was a useless attempt. My mind had been too much
     envelope. Finally, he examined with his glass the word upon the wall,
     day. It was a curious way of managing it, but, really, it would be
     difficult to suggest a better. The method was no doubt suggested to
     Clay's ingenious mind by the colour of his accomplice's hair. The £4
     a week was a lure which must draw him, and what was it to them, who
     were playing for thousands? They put in the advertisement, one rogue
     has the temporary office, the other rogue incites the man to apply
     for it, and together they manage to secure his absence every morning
     in the week. From the time that I heard of the assistant having come
     for half wages, it was obvious to me that he had some strong motive
     for securing the situation."

     of murdered immigrants and rifled camps in regions where Indians had
     vulgar intrigue. That, however, was out of the question. The man's
     breadth of a puddle on the garden walk which he had evidently walked
     bought the pair last night in the Strand, and I have never had them
     ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked,
     he'll be back here with a speed that would whip electro-telegraphs."

     dreadful voice, "My God, it's Nancy!"  Mrs. Barclay turned as white
     impatience followed, during which Holmes pricked up his ears at every
     ring of the bell. On the evening of the second there came a letter
     from Hilton Cubitt. All was quiet with him, save that a long
     inscription had appeared that morning upon the pedestal of the
     sun-dial. He inclosed a copy of it, which is here reproduced:--

     [ Picture: Picture of many dancing men figures ]

     "What time was it?"

     "'It rings true, eh?' said he. 'It's good enough to act upon?'

     "No, sir."

     "Then let us go and look at the room." With which inconsequent remark
     he strode on into the house, followed by Gregson, whose features
     expressed his astonishment.

     The worthy country policeman shook his head. "Seems to me the sooner
     we get London on to this case the better," said he. "White Mason is a
     smart man. No local job has ever been too much for White Mason. It
     won't be long now before he is here to help us. But I expect we'll
     have to look to London before we are through. Anyhow, I'm not ashamed
     to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me."

     "I've heard of you," said he in a voice which was not quite English
     place and, having first gauged his intelligence, I try to imagine how
     it is cut and marked all over from the habit of keeping other hard

          CHAPTER IV
          Darkness


     At three in the morning the chief Sussex detective, obeying the
     urgent call from Sergeant Wilson of Birlstone, arrived from
     headquarters in a light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter. By the
     five-forty train in the morning he had sent his message to Scotland
     Yard, and he was at the Birlstone station at twelve o'clock to
     welcome us. White Mason was a quiet, comfortable-looking person in a
     loose tweed suit, with a clean-shaved, ruddy face, a stoutish body,
     and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters, looking like a small
     farmer, a retired gamekeeper, or anything upon earth except a very
     favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer.

     "A real downright snorter, Mr. MacDonald!" he kept repeating. "We'll
     have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it. I'm hoping
     we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it
     and messing up all the trails. There has been nothing like this that
     I can remember. There are some bits that will come home to you, Mr.
     Holmes, or I am mistaken. And you also, Dr. Watson; for the medicos
     will have a word to say before we finish. Your room is at the
     Westville Arms. There's no other place; but I hear that it is clean
     and good. The man will carry your bags. This way, gentlemen, if you
     please."

     He was a very bustling and genial person, this Sussex detective. In
     ten minutes we had all found our quarters. In ten more we were seated
     in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of
     those events which have been outlined in the previous chapter.
     MacDonald made an occasional note, while Holmes sat absorbed, with
     the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the
     botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom.

     "Remarkable!" he said, when the story was unfolded, "most remarkable!
     I can hardly recall any case where the features have been more
     peculiar."

     "I thought you would say so, Mr. Holmes," said White Mason in great
     delight. "We're well up with the times in Sussex. I've told you now
     all the facts. I checked them and considered them and maybe added a
     few of my own."

     "What were they?" asked Holmes eagerly.

     I shrugged my shoulders. "If he were safely out of the country it
     us into a quadrangle paved with flags and lined by sordid dwellings.
     plan of part of a large building with numerous halls, corridors, and
     passages. At one point is a small cross done in red ink, and above it
     is '3.37 from left,' in faded pencil-writing.  In the left-hand
     their arms touching. Beside it is written, in very rough and coarse
     characters, 'The sign of the four,--Jonathan Small, Mahomet Singh,
     Abdullah Khan, Dost Akbar.' No, I confess that I do not see how this
     bears upon the matter. Yet it is evidently a document of importance.
     It has been kept carefully in a pocket-book; for the one side is as
     clean as the other."

     "Well, we are quite in your hands, Mr. Holmes," said old Cunningham.
     "Anything which you or the Inspector may suggest will most certainly
     be done."

     "My father was, as you may have guessed, Major John Sholto, once of
     strengthening each for the troubles that lay before us. The very next
     on, and there's no doubt it is the same party in each case. The man
     change in her. She would then be removed to his shed or hard, and so
     Murillo twisted my arm round until I gave him the address. I swear
     into his pocket and was gone. A few minutes elapsed, as you remember,
     her with the wondering questioning gaze of childhood.

          What John Rance Had To Tell









Iteration: 7000
     "'"You're not going away in any kind of spirit, Hudson, I hope," said
     my father, with a tameness which mad my blood boil.

     "'"I've not had my 'pology," said he sulkily, glancing in my
     direction.

     "'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow
     rather roughly," said the dad, turning to me.

     "'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary
     patience towards him," I answered.

     "'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarls. "Very good, mate. We'll see about
     that!"

     "'He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the
     house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night
     after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was
     recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.'

     "'And how?' I asked eagerly.

     "'In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father
     yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father
     read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round
     the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his
     senses. When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and
     eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a
     stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once. We put him to bed; but the
     paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning
     consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.'

     "'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried. 'What then could have been in
     this letter to cause so dreadful a result?'

     "'Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was
     absurd and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!'

     "As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the
     fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we
     dashed up to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a
     gentleman in black emerged from it.

     "'When did it happen, doctor?' asked Trevor.

     "'Almost immediately after you left.'

     "'Did he recover consciousness?'

     "'For an instant before the end.'

     "'Any message for me?'

     "'Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese
     cabinet.'

     "My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I
     remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my
     head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was
     the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how
     had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?  Why,
     too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon
     his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingham? 
     Then I remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr.
     Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to
     blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The
     letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that
     he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it
     might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a
     betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how
     could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? 
     He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those
     ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean
     another. I must see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in
     it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat
     pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought
     in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but
     composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his
     grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the
     table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a
     single sheet of gray paper. 'The supply of game for London is going
     steadily up,' it ran. 'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now
     told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
     hen-pheasant's life.'

     "I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when
     first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was
     evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried
     in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a
     prearranged significance to such phrases as 'fly-paper' and
     'hen-pheasant'?  Such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be
     deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the
     case, and the presence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the
     subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from
     Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the
     crouched by the window.

     putting his hand upon his shoulder. "Take my advice, and drive down
     to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist

     Lord St. Simon shook his head. "I am afraid that it will take wiser

     "You know my methods of work, Mr. Mac. But I will hold it back for
     with.  I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements.  Here
     are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless.  You
     see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. 
     Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not
     much less than two feet long--probably more if there is any tail. 
     But now observe this other measurement.  The animal has been moving,

     "For which he was entered?"

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
     taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in
     rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in
     any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it,
     therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished
     to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own
     writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be
     known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed

          CHAPTER VII
          The Episode of the Barrel


     The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss
     Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had
     borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker
     than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the
     side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first
     turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely
     had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me
     since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She
     little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of
     self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out
     to her, even as my hand had in the garden. I felt that years of the
     conventionalities of life could not teach me to know her sweet, brave
     ever, was waiting for us at the station. A walk of five minutes took
     as death, and would have fallen down had the dreadful-looking
     noiselessly about the room, sometimes stopping, occasionally

     government, so that no man will be a rupee the better for them. Now,
     since we do the taking of him, why should we not do the rest as well?
     The jewels will be as well with us as in the Company's coffers. There
     will be enough to make every one of us rich men and great chiefs. No
     one can know about the matter, for here we are cut off from all men.
     What could be better for the purpose?  Say again, then, Sahib,
     whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.'

     "'I am with you heart and soul,' said I.

     "'It is well,' he answered, handing me back my firelock. 'You see
     that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We
     have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.'

     "As a rule," said Holmes, "the more bizarre a thing is the less
     bit of a haze, and you could not see more than a few hundred yards. I
     certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting
     acknowledge that I have scored over you in your example."




          CHAPTER IV
          What John Rance Had To Tell





     better than laugh at me, I can go elsewhere."

     "No, sir; this is Mr. Johnson, the coal-owner, a very active
     lightning ten years ago, and we cut down the stump,'

     "I never heard tell on him," said the wanderer. "He appears to have
     small sitting-room and bedroom, and all complete, at the top of the
     house."

     Holmes had been seated for some hours in silence with his long, thin
     back curved over a chemical vessel in which he was brewing a
     every sort of crime in between. His chief of staff is Colonel
     Sebastian Moran, as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as
     Lestrade, and Holmes sprang upon him like so many staghounds. He was
     forget something that you knew before. It is of the highest
     importance, therefore, not to have useless facts elbowing out the
     house-tops, looking like the reflection of the mud-coloured streets
     have done it in twenty-four hours. Lecoq took six months or so. It
     put half-a-dozen of my farm lads in the shrubbery, and when this
     fellow comes again to give him such a hiding that he will leave us in
     the matter?"

     I had imagined that Sherlock Holmes would at once have hurried into
     as might, by repeated blows, have inflicted the terrible injuries to
     the reputation which I had won in the hospital brought me rapidly to
     the front, and during the last few years I have made him a rich man.

     "So much, Mr. Holmes, for my past history and my relations with Mr.
     precious time? Couldn't we start out and scour the country before the
     done with you."

     "You may argue--but I have too much respect for your judgment,
     separate mysteries here, but one only, and that if I could read the
     to the ground. "Thank God, I think that I hear him coming."

     "'These are coins of Charles the First,' said he, holding out the few
     I have spoken of the impression of flabbiness which this man
     it grew into a roomy villa. He was a man of a practical turn of mind,
     of the constables that I succeeded at last in carrying it to one
     side. A black hole yawned beneath into which we all peered, while
     Musgrave, kneeling at the side, pushed down the lantern.

     "A small chamber about seven feet deep and four feet square lay open
     to us. At one side of this was a squat, brass-bound wooden box, the
     lid of which was hinged upwards, with this curious old-fashioned key
     projecting from the lock. It was furred outside by a thick layer of
     dust, and damp and worms had eaten through the wood, so that a crop
     of livid fungi was growing on the inside of it. Several discs of
     metal, old coins apparently, such as I hold here, were scattered over
     the bottom of the box, but it contained nothing else.
















          CHAPTER III

     "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"

     "I do not know what to believe."

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

     "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     admit that the footmark is material."

     "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out,
     and yet he was diabolical as well."

     "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But
     now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have
     you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it
     is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me
     to do it."

     "I did not say that I desired you to do it."

     "Then, how can I assist you?"

     "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville,
     who arrives at Waterloo Station"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his
     watch--"in exactly one hour and a quarter."

     "He being the heir?"

     "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
     gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the
     accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
     way. I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of
     Sir Charles's will."

     "There is no other claimant, I presume?"

     "None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was
     Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir
     Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the
     father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of
     the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was
     the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He
     made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died
     paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning
     consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.'

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which
     ran as follows:

     By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was
     second son of the Duke of Balmoral, and Miss Hatty Doran, the only
     mighty oak, there stood a singular group of three people. One was a
     impetuous--volcanic, I was about to say. She is swift in making up
     her mind and fearless in carrying out her resolutions. On the other
     hand, I would not have given her the name which I have the honour to
     bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had not I thought her to be
     at bottom a noble woman. I believe that she is capable of heroic
     self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to
     her."

     "Have you her photograph?"

     "That, I am sure, cannot he true." said I, thinking of the beautiful
     well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a
     visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a
     take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive
     domicile.

     "I fear that we have."

     "Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear
     Watson--yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one,
     he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before
     his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says
     so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one
     which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He
     had it--and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson,
     it is a very common book."

     "What you say certainly sounds plausible."

     "So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed
     in double columns and in common use."

     "The Bible!" I cried triumphantly.

     "Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough!
     Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any
     volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of
     Moriarty's associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so
     numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the
     same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He
     knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page
     534."

     "But very few books would correspond with that."

     "Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to
     standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess."

     "Bradshaw!"

     "There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is
     nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly
     lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate
     Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same
     reason. What then is left?"

     "An almanac!"

     "Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched
     the spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's
     Almanac. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages.
     It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it
     becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end." He
     picked the volume from his desk. "Here is page 534, column two, a
     substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and
     resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number
     thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning.
     Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'Government'; which at least
     makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor
     Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do?
     Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are undone, my good
     Watson! It is finished!"

     He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy
     eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless
     and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a
     sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which
     he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.

     "We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!" he cried. "We
     are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the
     seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It
     is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one.
     No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been
     written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number
     thirteen is 'There,' which is much more promising. Number one hundred
     and twenty-seven is 'is'--'There is'"--Holmes's eyes were gleaming
     with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted
     the words--"'danger.' Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. 'There
     is danger-- may-- come-- very-- soon-- one.' Then we have the name
     'Douglas' --'rich-- country-- now-- at-- Birlstone-- House--
     Birlstone-- confidence-- is-- pressing.' There, Watson! What do you
     think of pure reason and its fruit? If the greengrocer had such a
     thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it."

     I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he
     stretching down to the Thames. As we reached it the fog was lifting,
     this moment?  Why, he's the chaplain of this ship--the chaplain, no
     case."

     "God bless your sweet calm face!" she cried, with an hysterical sob.
     "It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this
     double idea of regaining what he would consider to be his rights and
     avoid."

     the speaker's knee. When our visitor was silent Holmes stretched out
     he regarded as our desertion.

     "Footprints?"

     "Footprints."

     "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
     "When you search a single column for words with which to express your
     one must have been really intolerable."

     I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. "This is not a
     footmark," said I.

     "I think that this case is very much in your line. We have every hope
     of clearing the matter up, but we find a little difficulty in getting
     "Yours faithfully,
     companion whom I knew could only be his brother.

     "But why this elaborate deception?"

     "Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?"

     "'Did he recover consciousness?'

     "On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well," said Holmes.
     "When you search a single column for words with which to express your
     meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are
     bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent.
     The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one
     Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country
     gentleman. He is sure--'confidence' was as near as he could get to
     'confident'--that it is pressing. There is our result--and a very
     workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!"

     Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work,
     even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which
     he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung
     open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered
     into the room.

     Those were the early days at the end of the '80's, when Alec
     MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has
     now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective
     force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been
     entrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional
     physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous
     eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled
     out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with
     a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.

     Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success,
     his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For
     this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his
     amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness
     with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows
     nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius,
     and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to
     perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of
     one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his
     experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant
     of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.

     "You are an early bird, Mr. Mac," said he. "I wish you luck with your
     worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot."

     "If you said 'hope' instead of 'fear,' it would be nearer the truth,
     I'm thinking, Mr. Holmes," the inspector answered, with a knowing
     grin. "Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill.
     No, I won't smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way;
     for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows
     better than your own self. But--but--"

     The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of
     absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon
     which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.

     "Douglas!" he stammered. "Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man,
     it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
     get those names?"

     "My messenger reached you, then?" asked Holmes.

     "With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.
     it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
     get those names?"

     "It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But
     why--what's amiss with the names?"

     The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed
     astonishment. "Just this," said he, "that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone
     Manor House was horribly murdered last night!"






          CHAPTER VI
     "I have in my pocket a manuscript," said Dr. James Mortimer.


     On the morning which followed his interview with the Mormon Prophet,
     a woman's wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women,
     gentleman got away. Inspector!"

     "Have you the dates of those letters?"

     "But it must be late."

     "Then I can wait in the next room."

     "Not at all. This gentleman, Mr. Wilson, has been my partner and
     helper in many of my most successful cases, and I have no doubt that
     he will be of the utmost use to me in yours also."

     The stout gentleman half rose from his chair and gave a bob of
     greeting, with a quick little questioning glance from his small
     fat-encircled eyes.

     Carruthers nodded and Williamson swore.

     "Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do
     it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
     sustained against him. He had visited friends in Hammersmith that
     the constables, but I don't mind saying, in the presence of Dr.
     us at once to the rooms which we are to examine."

     "That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze."

     The inspector endeavoured to look interested.

     "There is no need why Dr. Watson should realize," said Barker
     leaning well back in his chair, "was a French artist who flourished
     between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working
     career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion
     formed of him by his contemporaries."

     The inspector's eyes grew abstracted. "Hadn't we better--" he said.

     "We are doing so," Holmes interrupted. "All that I am saying has a
     very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone
     there."

     "It was a piece of very simple reasoning."

     "With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'
     keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only
     get those names?"

     "That's so."

     "Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone."

     "Still, jealousy is a strange transformer of characters. Pray what is
     autumn of last year and found him in deep conversation with a very
     however, and I only trust that our little friend will not suffer from

     imagination."

     "From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember went
     of a man fresh from the fogs of Baker Street.

     "Good heavens, Holmes, this is intolerable!"

     "Exactly!"

     Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced
     towards me. "I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in
     the C. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over
     this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He
     ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the
     laughter.








     "What is it, madam?"


     Our meal was a merry one. Holmes coud talk exceedingly well when he
     chose, and that night he did choose. He appeared to be in a state of
     and corner. Even the rafters above our heads were lined by solemn
     around. These woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of
     the great Weald forest, which thins away until it reaches the
     northern chalk downs. A number of small shops have come into being to
     meet the wants of the increased population; so there seems some
     prospect that Birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a
     modern town. It is the centre for a considerable area of country,
     since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or
     twelve miles to the eastward, over the borders of Kent.

     About half a mile from the town, standing in an old park famous for
     its huge beech trees, is the ancient Manor House of Birlstone. Part
     of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first

     also it would seem this queer card--V. V. 341, whatever that may
     could be made out on the carpet, but none of any third person, which
     could imagine that our visitor was standing by the bedside and
     family honour more highly than I do. She knows it well, and she knew
     it before it gave a convulsive shiver in every limb, and lay as rigid
     woman's instinct; perhaps it was woman's instinct which gave me that
     feeling. At any rate, it was there, and I was keenly on the lookout
     who was a thin, dark, spectacled man, with a stoop which gave the
     all on fire to go over them. It was not mere curiosity, though I have

     "Yes; young Daulat Ras, an Indian student who lives on the same
     our agreement?'

     "Lestrade has got him all right," said Holmes, glancing up at me.
     "Perhaps it would interest you to hear what he says.

     He had hardly shut the door behind him when Holmes rose to put on his
     his forehead three times, shook his head solemnly, and hurried away.

     "Not entirely," said Holmes.

     "For my own part," the Duke continued, "I have advised the police to
     like; for I can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite
     nasty I shall shoot him dead." He took out his revolver as he spoke,

     "Exactly!"

     "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"

     "It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
     Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that
     if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would
     have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and
     the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be
     denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side
     depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by
     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
     Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious
     interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you
     and ask for your advice."

     Holmes considered for a little time.

     "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your opinion
     there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for
     a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"

     "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
     that this may be so."

     "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
     could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A
     devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too
     inconceivable a thing."

     "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would
     probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
     things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man
     will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty
     minutes. What would you recommend?"

     "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
     scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir
     Henry Baskerville."

     "And then?"

     "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my
     mind about the matter."

     "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"

     "Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
     much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of
     help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry
     Baskerville with you."

     "I will do so, Mr. Holmes." He scribbled the appointment on his
     shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
     fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

     "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir
     Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon
     the moor?"

     "Three people did."

     "Did any see it after?"

     "I have not heard of any."

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
     satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

     "Going out, Watson?"

     "Unless I can help you."

     "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you
     for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of
     view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound
     of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you
     could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should
     be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting
     problem which has been submitted to us this morning."

     I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
     in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he
     weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories,
     balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which
     points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day
     at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was
     nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once
     more.

     My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken
     out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp
     upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears
     were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco
     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I
     had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an
     armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of
     paper lay around him.

     "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.

     "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."

     "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."

     "Thick! It is intolerable."

     "Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
     perceive."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "Am I right?"

     "Certainly, but how?"

     He laughed at my bewildered expression.

     "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a
     pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your
     expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
     immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
     boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with
     intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
     obvious?"

     "Well, it is rather obvious."

     "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
     observes. Where do you think that I have been?"

     "A fixture also."

     "A fixture also."

     "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."

     "In spirit?"

     "Exactly. My body has remained in this arm-chair and has, I regret to
     observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
     incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
     Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my
     spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could
     find my way about."

     "A large scale map, I presume?"

     "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
     "Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is
     Baskerville Hall in the middle."

     "With a wood round it?"

     "Exactly. I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name,
     must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon
     the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of
     Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a
     radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered
     dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative.
     There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
     naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are
     two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles
     away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these
     scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is
     the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may
     help to play it again."

     "It must be a wild place."

     "Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
     hand in the affairs of men--"

     "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."

     "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There
     are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether
     any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime
     and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should
     be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws
     of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to
     exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I
     think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. It is a
     singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a
     concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of
     getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my
     convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"

     "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."

     "What do you make of it?"

     "It is very bewildering."

     "It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
     distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
     What do you make of that?"

     "Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
     the alley."

     "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should
     a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"

     "What then?"

     "He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,
     running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face."

     "Running from what?"

     "There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was
     crazed with fear before ever he began to run."

     "How can you say that?"

     "I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the
     moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had
     lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If
     the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help
     in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom
     was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the
     Yew Alley rather than in his own house?"

     "You think that he was waiting for someone?"

     "The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an
     evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is
     it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr.
     Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him
     credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"

     "But he went out every evening."

     "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening.
     On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night
     he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for
     London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I
     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."





          CHAPTER IV
          Sir Henry Baskerville


     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious
     face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten
     appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
     yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of
     his bearing which indicated the gentleman.

     "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.

     "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
     that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this
     morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you
     think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants
     more thinking out than I am able to give it."

     "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
     have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
     London?"

     "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
     It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me
     this morning."

     He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was
     of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir Henry
     Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters;
     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     evening.

     "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked
     Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

     "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     "No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor. "There was
     no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel."

     "Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements."
     Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded
     into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the
     middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of
     pasting printed words upon it. It ran:

     As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

     The word "moor" only was printed in ink.

     "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
     Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that
     Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters;
     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     and fluttered down upon us as we passed. The rattle of our wheels
     It was locked, but the key had been left on the outside.  Holmes
     say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no
     consequence to me."

     With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began
     the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace
     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I
     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's
     words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.

     "It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's
     enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a
     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their
     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,
     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any
     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should
     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done
     the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my
     place.

     "That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.
     She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart
     over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed
     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his
     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I
     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his
     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to
     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is
     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and
     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left
     for me to hope for, or to desire.

     "They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving
     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a
     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain
     sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for
     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along
     somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that
     of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most
     confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted
     the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.

     "It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were
     living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across
     them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other
     side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them
     at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their
     recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my
     opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.

     "They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then
     they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or
     late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get
     behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long
     as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.

     "They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there
     was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out
     alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind
     them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was
     drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I
     watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but
     I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost
     come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a
     little too soon and leave my work undone.

     "At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as
     the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive
     up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a
     time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up
     my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for
     I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston
     Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed
     them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train,
     and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be
     another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but
     Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in
     the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them.
     Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that
     if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His
     companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had
     resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a
     delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what
     Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and
     reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that
     he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it
     up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the
     last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which
     Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven,
     and made his way out of the station.

     "The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my
     enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but
     singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue
     precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction
     in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that
     strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans
     arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who
     had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It
     chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in
     looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of
     one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and
     returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a
     duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one
     spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from
     interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult
     problem which I had now to solve.

     "He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops,
     staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out
     he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was
     a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so
     close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the
     whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of
     streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the
     Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his
     intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab
     a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom
     drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets
     dry with the talking."

     In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts
     wheels of his trap in the yard, and, looking out of my window, I saw
     really, but for the happy chance of your being in the town, I should
     his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a
     sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of
     tangled black hair, and a coloured purple stole round his neck, so
     about, and that the night was still very wild. I had driven some
     distance when I put my hand into the pocket in which I usually kept
     who had betrayed them.

     "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
     Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that
     he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for
     London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I
     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business
     the sound which resembled the distant baying of a hound. It is
     to the left of me. It seemed to me to be something grey in colour, a
     appeared from the newspaper advertisement, they had stunned him with

Iteration: 10000
     "'"You're not going away in any kind of spirit, Hudson, I hope," said
     my father, with a tameness which mad my blood boil.

     "'"I've not had my 'pology," said he sulkily, glancing in my
     direction.

     "'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow
     rather roughly," said the dad, turning to me.

     "'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary
     patience towards him," I answered.

     "'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarls. "Very good, mate. We'll see about
     that!"

     "'He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the
     house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night
     after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was
     recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.'

     "'And how?' I asked eagerly.

     "'In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father
     yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father
     read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round
     the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his
     senses. When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and
     eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a
     stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once. We put him to bed; but the
     paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning
     consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.'

     "'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried. 'What then could have been in
     this letter to cause so dreadful a result?'

     "'Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was
     absurd and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!'

     "As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the
     fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we
     dashed up to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a
     gentleman in black emerged from it.

     "'When did it happen, doctor?' asked Trevor.

     "'Almost immediately after you left.'

     "'Did he recover consciousness?'

     "'For an instant before the end.'

     "'Any message for me?'

     "'Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese
     cabinet.'

     "My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I
     remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my
     head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was
     the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how
     had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?  Why,
     too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon
     his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingham? 
     Then I remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr.
     Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to
     blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The
     letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that
     he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it
     might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a
     betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how
     could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? 
     He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those
     ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean
     another. I must see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in
     it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat
     pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought
     in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but
     composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his
     grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the
     table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a
     single sheet of gray paper. 'The supply of game for London is going
     steadily up,' it ran. 'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now
     told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
     hen-pheasant's life.'

     "I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when
     first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was
     evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried
     in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a
     prearranged significance to such phrases as 'fly-paper' and
     'hen-pheasant'?  Such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be
     deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the
     case, and the presence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the
     subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from
     Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the
     combination 'life pheasant's hen' was not encouraging. Then I tried
     alternate words, but neither 'the of for' nor 'supply game London'
     promised to throw any light upon it.

     "And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I
     saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a
     message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.

     "It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my
     companion:

     "What is it, then?"

     "My blushes, Watson!" Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.

     "Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands, 'It must be
     that, I suppose,' said he. "This is worse than death, for it means
     disgrace as well. But what is the meaning of these "head-keepers" and
     "hen-pheasants"?

     "'It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to
     anxiously.

     "No, sir."

     "Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this
     letter?"

     "Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the
     pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased
     by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good
     heavens, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost

     "All is well that ends well," said Holmes. "But I certainly did not
     know that the Aurora was such a clipper."

     "Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that
     if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should
     never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood
     business."

     "Neither he did," cried our prisoner,--"not a word. I chose his
     launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but
     we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached
     our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the
     Brazils."

     "Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future
     lives."







                                Table of contents

     "Never better. She kept talking of what we should do in our future
     lives."

     "Indeed! That is very interesting. And on the morning of the
     wedding?"

     "She was as bright as possible--at least until after the ceremony."

     "And did you observe any change in her then?"

     "Well, to tell the truth, I saw then the first signs that I had ever
     seen that her temper was just a little sharp. The incident however,
     was too trivial to relate and can have no possible bearing upon the
     case."

     "Pray let us have it, for all that."

     "Oh, it is childish. She dropped her bouquet as we went towards the
     vestry. She was passing the front pew at the time, and it fell over
     into the pew. There was a moment's delay, but the gentleman in the
     pew handed it up to her again, and it did not appear to be the worse
     for the fall. Yet when I spoke to her of the matter, she answered me
     abruptly; and in the carriage, on our way home, she seemed absurdly
     agitated over this trifling cause."

     "There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine.  This
     had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would
     my friends in such horrible peril."

     "Before they come," said Holmes, "just put your hand here on this
     poor fellow's arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?"

     "The muscles are as hard as a board," I answered.

     "Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding
     the usual rigor mortis. Coupled with this distortion of the face,
     this Hippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers
     called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?"

     "Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid," I answered,--"some
     strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus."

     "That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn
     muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for
     the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I
     discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force
     into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would
     be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in
     his chair. Now examine the thorn."

     I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was
     long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though
     some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been
     trimmed and rounded off with a knife.

     "Is that an English thorn?" he asked.

     "No, it certainly is not."

     "With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.
     But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat a
     retreat."

     As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on
     the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode
     heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a
     pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from
     between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an
     inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.

     "Here's a business!" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. "Here's a
     pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as
     full as a rabbit-warren!"

     "I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones," said Holmes,
     quietly.

     "Why, of course I do!" he wheezed. "It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the
     theorist. Remember you! I'll never forget how you lectured us all on
     causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It's
     true you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was
     more by good luck than good guidance."

     "It was a piece of very simple reasoning."

     "Oh, come, now, come! Never be ashamed to own up. But what is all
     this? Bad business! Bad business! Stern facts here,--no room for
     theories. How lucky that I happened to be out at Norwood over another
     case! I was at the station when the message arrived. What d'you think
     the man died of?"

     "Oh, this is hardly a case for me to theorize over," said Holmes,
     dryly.

     "No, no. Still, we can't deny that you hit the nail on the head
     sometimes. Dear me! Door locked, I understand. Jewels worth half a
     million missing. How was the window?"

     "Fastened; but there are steps on the sill."

     "Well, well, if it was fastened the steps could have nothing to do
     with the matter. That's common sense. Man might have died in a fit;
     but then the jewels are missing. Ha! I have a theory. These flashes
     come upon me at times.--Just step outside, sergeant, and you, Mr.
     Sholto. Your friend can remain.--What do you think of this, Holmes?
     Sholto was, on his own confession, with his brother last night. The
     brother died in a fit, on which Sholto walked off with the treasure.
     How's that?"

     "On which the dead man very considerately got up and locked the door
     on the inside."

     "Hum! There's a flaw there. Let us apply common sense to the matter.
     This Thaddeus Sholto was with his brother; there was a quarrel; so
     much we know. The brother is dead and the jewels are gone. So much
     also we know. No one saw the brother from the time Thaddeus left him.
     His bed had not been slept in. Thaddeus is evidently in a most
     disturbed state of mind. His appearance is--well, not attractive. You



     "There goes the reward!" said he, gloomily. "Where there is no money
     there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner
     each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there."

     "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man," I said. "He will see that you
     are rewarded, treasure or no."

     The inspector shook his head despondently, however. "It's a bad job,"
     he repeated; "and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think."

     His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank
     enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They
     had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had
     changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon
     the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual
     listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with
     his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty
     box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.

     "This is your doing, Small," said Athelney Jones, angrily.

     "Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it," he
     cried, exultantly. "It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot
     I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no
     living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the
     Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have
     the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through
     for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us
     always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have
     done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to
     kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich
     that we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is,
     and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us,
     I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this
     journey."

     "You are deceiving us, Small," said Athelney Jones, sternly. "If you
     had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been
     easier for you to have thrown box and all."

     "Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover," he answered,
     with a shrewd, sidelong look. "The man that was clever enough to hunt
     me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a
     river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a
     harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when
     you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I've
     had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry
     over spilled milk."

     "This is a very serious matter, Small," said the detective. "If you
     when a clever man turns his brains to crime it is the worst of all. I

     as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man;
     and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and
     energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.

     "If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you
     are the man for it," he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at
     my fellow-lodger. "The way you kept on my trail was a caution."

     "You had better come with me," said Holmes to the two detectives.

     One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
     half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of
     Sussex. For centuries it had remained unchanged; but within the last
     few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a
     number of well-to-do residents, whose villas peep out from the woods
     around. These woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of
     the great Weald forest, which thins away until it reaches the
     northern chalk downs. A number of small shops have come into being to
     meet the wants of the increased population; so there seems some
     prospect that Birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a
     modern town. It is the centre for a considerable area of country,
     since Tunbridge Wells, the nearest place of importance, is ten or
     twelve miles to the eastward, over the borders of Kent.

     "Most certainly there is," I answered.

     "That is a detail which I shall speedily supply."

     "No one save the printer."

     "Did this man Bannister know?"

     "And when I raise my hand--so--you will throw into the room what I

     long before the missing boot is found."

     "And, now, gentlemen," said the baronet with decision, "it seems to
     me that I have spoken quite enough about the little that I know. It
     is time that you kept your promise and gave me a full account of what
     we are all driving at."

     "Your request is a very reasonable one," Holmes answered. "Dr.

                       THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET

     expression of absolute astonishment came over her face.

     "Then for the first time the horror of my situation came in its full
     Baskerville. One was Theophilus Johnson and family, of Newcastle; the
     other Mrs. Oldmore and maid, of High Lodge, Alton.

     "Surely that must be the same Johnson whom I used to know," said
     Holmes to the porter. "A lawyer, is he not, gray-headed, and walks
     with a limp?"

     "Holmes," said I as I stood one morning in our bow-window looking

     she had the exact physical characteristics which Holmes had divined,
     this, like so many other wonderful happenings, will find its end.

     "My practice--" I began.

     "And yet the writing is of interest."

     "'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it
     to a wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I
     continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who
     am I?'

     "Exactly."


Iteration: 11000
     "And from the same cause," said Holmes. "These are the traces of the
     treasure-seekers. You must remember that they were six years looking
     for it. No wonder that the grounds look like a gravel-pit."

     At that moment the door of the house burst open, and Thaddeus Sholto
     came running out, with his hands thrown forward and terror in his
     eyes.

     "There is something amiss with Bartholomew!" he cried. "I am
     frightened! My nerves cannot stand it." He was, indeed, half
     blubbering with fear, and his twitching feeble face peeping out from
     the great Astrakhan collar had the helpless appealing expression of a
     terrified child.

     "Come into the house," said Holmes, in his crisp, firm way.

     "Yes, do!" pleaded Thaddeus Sholto. "I really do not feel equal to
     giving directions."

     We all followed him into the housekeeper's room, which stood upon the
     left-hand side of the passage. The old woman was pacing up and down
     with a scared look and restless picking fingers, but the sight of
     Miss Morstan appeared to have a soothing effect upon her.

     "God bless your sweet calm face!" she cried, with an hysterical sob.
     "It does me good to see you. Oh, but I have been sorely tried this
     day!"

     Our companion patted her thin, work-worn hand, and murmured some few
     words of kindly womanly comfort which brought the color back into the
     others bloodless cheeks.

     "Master has locked himself in and will now answer me," she explained.
     "All day I have waited to hear from him, for he often likes to be
     alone; but an hour ago I feared that something was amiss, so I went
     up and peeped through the key-hole. You must go up, Mr.
     Thaddeus,--you must go up and look for yourself. I have seen Mr.
     Bartholomew Sholto in joy and in sorrow for ten long years, but I
     never saw him with such a face on him as that."

     Sherlock Holmes took the lamp and led the way, for Thaddeus Sholto's
     teeth were chattering in his head. So shaken was he that I had to
     pass my hand under his arm as we went up the stairs, for his knees
     were trembling under him. Twice as we ascended Holmes whipped his
     lens out of his pocket and carefully examined marks which appeared to
     me to be mere shapeless smudges of dust upon the cocoa-nut matting
     which served as a stair-carpet. He walked slowly from step to step,
     holding the lamp, and shooting keen glances to right and left. Miss
     Morstan had remained behind with the frightened housekeeper.

     The third flight of stairs ended in a straight passage of some
     length, with a great picture in Indian tapestry upon the right of it
     and three doors upon the left. Holmes advanced along it in the same
     slow and methodical way, while we kept close at his heels, with our
     long black shadows streaming backwards down the corridor. The third
     door was that which we were seeking. Holmes knocked without receiving
     any answer, and then tried to turn the handle and force it open. It
     was locked on the inside, however, and by a broad and powerful bolt,
     as we could see when we set our lamp up against it. The key being
     turned, however, the hole was not entirely closed. Sherlock Holmes
     bent down to it, and instantly rose again with a sharp intaking of
     the breath.

     "There is something devilish in this, Watson," said he, more moved
     than I had ever before seen him. "What do you make of it?"

     I stooped to the hole, and recoiled in horror. Moonlight was
     streaming into the room, and it was bright with a vague and shifty
     radiance. Looking straight at me, and suspended, as it were, in the
     air, for all beneath was in shadow, there hung a face,--the very face
     of our companion Thaddeus. There was the same high, shining head, the
     same circular bristle of red hair, the same bloodless countenance.
     The features were set, however, in a horrible smile, a fixed and
     unnatural grin, which in that still and moonlit room was more jarring
     to the nerves than any scowl or contortion. So like was the face to
     that of our little friend that I looked round at him to make sure
     that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had
     mentioned to us that his brother and he were twins.

     "This is terrible!" I said to Holmes. "What is to be done?"

     "This is terrible!" I said to Holmes. "What is to be done?"

     "The door must come down," he answered, and, springing against it, he
     put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not
     yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time
     it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within
     Bartholomew Sholto's chamber.

     It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double
     line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite
     the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners,
     test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in
     wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken,
     for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the
     air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor. A set of
     steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath
     and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large
     enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long
     coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.

     By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was
     seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and
     that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold,
     and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only
     his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most
     fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar
     instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a
     hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn
     sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced
     at it, and then handed it to me.

     "You see," he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.

     In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, "The
     sign of the four."

     "In God's name, what does it all mean?" I asked.

     "It means murder," said he, stooping over the dead man. "Ah, I
     expected it. Look here!" He pointed to what looked like a long, dark
     thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.

     "It looks like a thorn," said I.

     "It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is
     poisoned."

     I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin
     so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of
     blood showed where the puncture had been.

     "This is all an insoluble mystery to me," said I. "It grows darker
     instead of clearer."

     "On the contrary," he answered, "it clears every instant. I only
     require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case."

     We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the
     chamber. He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of
     terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,
     he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.

     "The treasure is gone!" he said. "They have robbed him of the
     treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him
     to do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last
     night, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs."

     "What time was that?"

     "It was ten o'clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be
     called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh,
     yes, I am sure I shall. But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you
     don't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you
     here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!"
     He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive
     frenzy.

     "You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes, kindly,
     putting his hand upon his shoulder. "Take my advice, and drive down
     to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist
     them in every way. We shall wait here until your return."

     The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him
     stumbling down the stairs in the dark.





          CHAPTER VI
          Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration


     "Now, Watson," said Holmes, rubbing his hands, "we have half an hour
     to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told
     you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of
     over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something
     deeper underlying it."

     "Simple!" I ejaculated.

     "Surely," said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor
     expounding to his class. "Just sit in the corner there, that your
     footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first
     place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not
     been opened since last night. How of the window?" He carried the lamp
     across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but
     addressing them to himself rather than to me. "Window is snibbed on
     the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us
     open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has
     mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the
     print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy
     mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See
     here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration."

     I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. "This is not a
     footmark," said I.

     "It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a
     wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot
     with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the
     timber-toe."

     "It is the wooden-legged man."

     "Quite so. But there has been some one else,--a very able and
     efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?"

     I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on
     that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground,
     and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a
     crevice in the brick-work.

     "It is absolutely impossible," I answered.

     "Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who
     lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing
     one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you
     were an active man, you might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would
     depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up
     the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the
     inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor
     point it may be noted," he continued, fingering the rope, "that our
     wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional
     sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than
     one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I
     gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin
     off his hand."

     "This is all very well," said I, "but the thing becomes more
     unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he
     into the room?"

     An instant later our door opened, and a tall young man entered the
     said he.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy

     "That's what they call it," he said, placidly. "I went to a Doctor
     he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also
     know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is
     no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?"

     "He came through the hole in the roof," I cried.

     "It will be clear enough to you soon," he said, in an off-hand way.
     "I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will
     look." He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about
     the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long
     thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes
     gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and
     furtive were his movements, like those of a trained blood-hound
     picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible
     criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity
     against the law, instead of exerting them in its defense. As he
     hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out
     into a loud crow of delight.

     "We are certainly in luck," said he. "We ought to have very little
     trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the
     creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here
     at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked,
     You see, and the stuff has leaked out."

     "What then?" I asked.

     "Why, we have got him, that's all," said he. "I know a dog that would
     follow that scent to the world's end. If a pack can track a trailed
     herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow
     so pungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of
     now as safe as if it were in the fire."

     Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below,
     and the hall door shut with a loud crash.

     "Before they come," said Holmes, "just put your hand here on this
     poor fellow's arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?"

     "The muscles are as hard as a board," I answered.

     "Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding
     the usual rigor mortis. Coupled with this distortion of the face,
     this Hippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers
     called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?"

     "Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid," I answered,--"some
     strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus."

     "That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn
     muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for
     the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I
     discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force
     into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would
     be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in
     his chair. Now examine the thorn."

     I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was
     long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though
     some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been
     trimmed and rounded off with a knife.

     "Is that an English thorn?" he asked.

     "No, it certainly is not."

     "With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.
     But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat a
     retreat."

     As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on
     the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode
     heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a
     pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from
     between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an
     inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.

     "Here's a business!" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. "Here's a
     pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as
     full as a rabbit-warren!"

     "I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones," said Holmes,
     carefully examined that which was uppermost.



          CHAPTER II
     him at it with my own eyes."

     "It would be of the greatest interest to me," she said. There was no
     kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches
     to the room above,--the secret room in which the treasure was found."

     He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he
     swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached
     down for the lamp and held it while I followed him.

     The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way
     and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin
     lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from
     beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner
     shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any
     sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.

     "Here you are, you see," said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand
     moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm.
     There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible
     swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached
     reputation in Birlstone.





          CHAPTER VII
          The Trapping of Birdy Edwards


     The police had brought a cab with them, and in this I escorted Miss
     Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had
     borne trouble with a calm face as long as there was some one weaker
     than herself to support, and I had found her bright and placid by the
     side of the frightened housekeeper. In the cab, however, she first
     turned faint, and then burst into a passion of weeping,--so sorely
     had she been tried by the adventures of the night. She has told me
     since that she thought me cold and distant upon that journey. She
     little guessed the struggle within my breast, or the effort of
     self-restraint which held me back. My sympathies and my love went out
     the case to the next Assizes. Those are the main facts of the case as
     was a fatal one. He was dead within five minutes. There he lay in the
     slope which showed where the man was lying who had come so horribly
     days later they were married in Chicago, with old Jacob Shafter as
     in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his
     Street picture galleries and fill in the time until we are due at the
     hotel."





          CHAPTER VIII
          First Report of Dr. Watson


     From this point onward I will follow the course of events by
     transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before
     me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
     as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more
     accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events,
     can possibly do.

     Baskerville Hall, October 13th.

     Out came the official notebook.

     "Wait a bit, Gregson," said Sherlock Holmes. "All you desire is a
     excursion. He held in his hand a sheet of blue paper, scrawled over
     laughter.

     "Dead?  Did you say he was dead?"

     And so it was arranged. Resisting Stapleton's offer of hospitality,
     inspector, it is good enough for me," he said at last.

     "Certainly," I answered.

     "Someone may have shaken the box and displaced it."

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     "We have been expecting you in these parts since Dr. Watson came
     down. You are in time to see a tragedy."

     With strained ears the murderers waited. They counted the steps of
     Bernstone, and from the Indian servant, who, Mr. Thaddeus tell me,
     evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"

     The train had already begun to move as Holmes spoke.  Glancing back,
     I saw a tall man pushing his way furiously through the crowd, and
     waving his hand as if he desired to have the train stopped.  It was
     too late, however, for we were rapidly gathering momentum, and an
     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the
     in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that
     London?"

     The inspector's eyes grew abstracted. "Hadn't we better--" he said.

     "Yes."

     "And, now, gentlemen," said the baronet with decision, "it seems to
     it?" He opened his bag as he spoke, and tumbled onto the floor a
     poisoned, was in the man's scalp where you still see the mark; this
     card, inscribed as you see it, was on the table; and beside it lay
     this rather curious stone-headed instrument. How does all that fit
     into your theory?"

     "Confirms it in every respect," said the fat detective, pompously.
     "House is full of Indian curiosities. Thaddeus brought this up, and
     if this splinter be poisonous Thaddeus may as well have made
     murderous use of it as any other man. The card is some
     hocus-pocus,--a blind, as like as not. The only question is, how did
     he depart? Ah, of course, here is a hole in the roof." With great
     activity, considering his bulk, he sprang up the steps and squeezed
     through into the garret, and immediately afterwards we heard his
     exulting voice proclaiming that he had found the trap-door.

     "He can find something," remarked Holmes, shrugging his shoulders.
     "He has occasional glimmerings of reason. Il n'y a pas des sots si
     incommodes que ceux qui ont de l'esprit!"

     "You see!" said Athelney Jones, reappearing down the steps again.
     "Facts are better than mere theories, after all. My view of the case
     is confirmed. There is a trap-door communicating with the roof, and
     it is partly open."

     "It was I who opened it."

     "Oh, indeed! You did notice it, then?" He seemed a little crestfallen
     at the discovery. "Well, whoever noticed it, it shows how our
     gentleman got away. Inspector!"

     "Yes, sir," from the passage.

     "Ask Mr. Sholto to step this way.--Mr. Sholto, it is my duty to
     inform you that anything which you may say will be used against you.
     I arrest you in the Queen's name as being concerned in the death of
     your brother."

     "There, now! Didn't I tell you!" cried the poor little man, throwing
     out his hands, and looking from one to the other of us.

     "Don't trouble yourself about it, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes. "I think
     that I can engage to clear you of the charge."

     "Don't promise too much, Mr. Theorist,--don't promise too much!"
     snapped the detective. "You may find it a harder matter than you
     think."

     "Not only will I clear him, Mr. Jones, but I will make you a free
     present of the name and description of one of the two people who were
     in this room last night. His name, I have every reason to believe, is
     Jonathan Small. He is a poorly-educated man, small, active, with his
     right leg off, and wearing a wooden stump which is worn away upon the
     inner side. His left boot has a coarse, square-toed sole, with an
     iron band round the heel. He is a middle-aged man, much sunburned,
     and has been a convict. These few indications may be of some
     assistance to you, coupled with the fact that there is a good deal of
     skin missing from the palm of his hand. The other man--"

     "Ah! the other man--?" asked Athelney Jones, in a sneering voice, but
     impressed none the less, as I could easily see, by the precision of
     the other's manner.

     "Is a rather curious person," said Sherlock Holmes, turning upon his
     heel. "I hope before very long to be able to introduce you to the
     pair of them. A word with you, Watson."

     He led me out to the head of the stair. "This unexpected occurrence,"
     he said, "has caused us rather to lose sight of the original purpose
     of our journey."

Iteration: 12000
     "'"You're not going away in any kind of spirit, Hudson, I hope," said
     my father, with a tameness which mad my blood boil.

     "'"I've not had my 'pology," said he sulkily, glancing in my
     direction.

     "'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow
     rather roughly," said the dad, turning to me.

     "'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary
     patience towards him," I answered.

     "'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarls. "Very good, mate. We'll see about
     that!"

     "'He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the
     house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night
     after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was
     recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.'

     "'And how?' I asked eagerly.

     "'In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father
     yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father
     read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round
     the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his
     senses. When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and
     eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a
     stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once. We put him to bed; but the
     paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning
     consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.'

     "'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried. 'What then could have been in
     this letter to cause so dreadful a result?'

     "'Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was
     absurd and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!'

     "As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the
     fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we
     dashed up to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a
     gentleman in black emerged from it.

     "'When did it happen, doctor?' asked Trevor.

     "'Almost immediately after you left.'

     "'Did he recover consciousness?'

     "'For an instant before the end.'

     "'Any message for me?'

     "'Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese
     cabinet.'

     "My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I
     remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my
     head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was
     the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how
     had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?  Why,
     too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon
     his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingham? 
     Then I remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr.
     Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to
     blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The
     letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that
     he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it
     might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a
     betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how
     could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? 
     He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those
     ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean
     another. I must see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in
     it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat
     pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought
     in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but
     composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his
     grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the
     table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a
     single sheet of gray paper. 'The supply of game for London is going
     steadily up,' it ran. 'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now
     told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
     hen-pheasant's life.'

     "I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when
     first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was
     evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried
     in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a
     prearranged significance to such phrases as 'fly-paper' and
     'hen-pheasant'?  Such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be
     deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the
     case, and the presence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the
     subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from
     Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the
     combination 'life pheasant's hen' was not encouraging. Then I tried
     alternate words, but neither 'the of for' nor 'supply game London'
     promised to throw any light upon it.

     "And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I
     saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a
     message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.

     "It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my
     companion:

     "'The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.'

     "Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands, 'It must be
     that, I suppose,' said he. "This is worse than death, for it means
     disgrace as well. But what is the meaning of these "head-keepers" and
     "hen-pheasants"?

     "'It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to
     us if we had no other means of discovering the sender. You see that
     he has begun by writing "The ... game ... is," and so on. Afterwards
     he had, to fulfill the prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words
     in each space. He would naturally use the first words which came to
     his mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among
     them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or
     interested in breeding. Do you know anything of this Beddoes?'

     "'Why, now that you mention it,' said he, 'I remember that my poor
     father used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his
     preserves every autumn.'

     "'Then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes,' said I. 'It
     only remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor
     Hudson seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and
     respected men.'

     "'Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and shame!' cried my
     friend. 'But from you I shall have no secrets. Here is the statement
     which was drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from
     Hudson had become imminent. I found it in the Japanese cabinet, as he
     told the doctor. Take it and read it to me, for I have neither the
     strength nor the courage to do it myself.'

     "These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will
     read them to you, as I read them in the old study that night to him.
     They are endorsed outside, as you see, 'Some particulars of the
     voyage of the bark Gloria Scott, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th
     14' on Nov. 6th.' It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this
     way:

     "'My dear, dear son, now that approaching disgrace begins to darken
     the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty
     that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my
     position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have
     known me, which cuts me to the heart; but it is the thought that you
     should come to blush for me--you who love me and who have seldom, I
     hope, had reason to do other than respect me. But if the blow falls
     which is forever hanging over me, then I should wish you to read
     this, that you may know straight from me how far I have been to
     blame. On the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind God
     Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still
     undestroyed and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by all
     you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love
     which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give
     one thought to it again.

     "'If then your eye goes onto read this line, I know that I shall
     already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more
     likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue
     sealed forever in death. In either case the time for suppression is
     past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I
     swear as I hope for mercy.

     "'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my
     younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me
     a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which
     seemed to imply that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was
     that I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage I was
     convicted of breaking my country's laws, and was sentenced to
     transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
     debt of honor, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money which
     was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it
     before there could be any possibility of its being missed. But the
     most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had reckoned
     upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts
     exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with,
     but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than
     now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a
     felon with thirty-seven other convicts in 'tween-decks of the bark
     Gloria Scott, bound for Australia.

     "'It was the year '55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the
     old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black
     Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less
     suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. The Gloria Scott
     had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
     heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her
     out. She was a five-hundred-ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight
     jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a
     captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly
     a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from
     Falmouth.

     "'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being
     of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and
     frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had
     particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a young
     man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather
     nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a
     swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for
     his extraordinary height. I don't think any of our heads would have
     come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have
     measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many
     sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and
     resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I
     was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still
     when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear,
     and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which
     separated us.

     "'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here
     for?"

     "'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.

     "'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and by God! You'll learn to bless
     my name before you've done with me."

     "'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an
     immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own
     arrest. He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of
     incurably vicious habits, who had, by an ingenious system of fraud,
     obtained huge sums of money from the leading London merchants.

     "'"Ha, ha! You remember my case!" said he proudly.

     "'"Very well, indeed."

     "'"Then maybe you remember something queer about it?"

     "'"What was that, then?"

     "'"I'd had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn't I?"

     "'"So it was said."

     "'"But none was recovered, eh?"

     "'"No."

     "'"Well, where d'ye suppose the balance is?" he asked.

     "'"I have no idea," said I.

     "'"Right between my finger and thumb," he cried. "By God! I've got
     more pounds to my name than you've hairs on your head. And if you've
     money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do
     anything. Now, you don't think it likely that a man who could do
     anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking
     hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a Chin
     China coaster. No, sir, such a man will look after himself and will
     look after his chums. You may lay to that! You hold on to him, and
     you may kiss the book that he'll haul you through."

     "'That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant
     nothing; but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in
     with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really
     was a plot to gain command of the vessel. A dozen of the prisoners
     had hatched it before they came aboard, Prendergast was the leader,
     and his money was the motive power.

     "'"I'd a partner," said he, "a rare good man, as true as a stock to a
     barrel. He's got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at
     this moment?  Why, he's the chaplain of this ship--the chaplain, no
     less! He came aboard with a black coat, and his papers right, and
     money enough in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to
     main-truck. The crew are his, body and soul. He could buy 'em at so
     much a gross with a cash discount, and he did it before ever they
     signed on. He's got two of the warders and Mercer, the second mate,
     and he'd get the captain himself, if he thought him worth it."

     "'"What are we to do, then?" I asked.

     "'"What do you think?" said he. "We'll make the coats of some of
     these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did."

     "'"But they are armed," said I.

     "'"And so shall we be, my boy. There's a brace of pistols for every
     mother's son of us, and if we can't carry this ship, with the crew at
     our back, it's time we were all sent to a young misses'
     boarding-school. You speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and
     see if he is to be trusted."

     "'I did so, and found my other neighbor to be a young fellow in much
     the same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. His name
     was Evans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and he is now a
     rich and prosperous man in the south of England. He was ready enough
     to join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and
     before we had crossed the Bay there were only two of the prisoners
     who were not in the secret. One of these was of weak mind, and we did
     not dare to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice, and
     could not be of any use to us.

     "'From the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us from
     taking possession of the ship. The crew were a set of ruffians,
     specially picked for the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells
     to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts,
     and so often did he come that by the third day we had each stowed
     away at the foot of our beds a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of
     powder, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders were agents of
     Prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man. The captain,
     the two mates, two warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen soldiers,
     and the doctor were all that we had against us. Yet, safe as it was,
     we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack
     suddenly by night. It came, however, more quickly than we expected,
     and in this way.

     "'One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had
     come down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting his
     hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of the
     pistols. If he had been silent he might have blown the whole thing,
     but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and
     turned so pale that the man knew what was up in an instant and seized
     him. He was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon
     the bed. He had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were
     through it in a rush. The two sentries were shot down, and so was a
     corporal who came running to see what was the matter. There were two
     more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed
     not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot
     while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into the
     captain's cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an
     explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared over
     the chart of the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table, while the
     chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow. The
     two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business
     seemed to be settled.

     "'The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and
     flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just
     mad with the feeling that we were free once more. There were lockers
     all round, and Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and
     pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. We cracked off the necks of the
     bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing
     them off, when in an instant without warning there came the roar of
     muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we
     could not see across the table. When it cleared again the place was a
     shambles. Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each
     other on the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table
     turn me sick now when I think of it. We were so cowed by the sight
     that I think we should have given the job up if had not been for
     Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all
     that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the poop
     were the lieutenent and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the
     saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through
     the slit.  We got on them before they could load, and they stood to
     it like men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes
     it was all over. My God! Was there ever a slaughter-house like that
     ship! Predergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers
     up as if they had been children and threw them overboard alive or
     dead. There was one sergeant that was horribly wounded and yet kept
     on swimming for a surprising time, until some one in mercy blew out
     his brains. When the fighting was over there was no one left of our
     enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor.

     "'It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many of
     us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no
     wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the
     soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another
     to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. Eight of us,
     five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done.
     But there was no moving Predergast and those who were with him. Our
     only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and
     he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. It
     nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he
     said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. We jumped at the
     offer, for we were already sick of these blookthirsty doings, and we
     saw that there would be worse before it was done. We were given a
     suit of sailor togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk
     and one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw us over a
     chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had
     foundered in Lat. 15° and Long. 25° west, and then cut the painter
     and let us go.

     "'And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear
     son. The seamen had hauled the fore-yard aback during the rising, but
     now as we left them they brought it square again, and as there was a
     light wind from the north and east the bark began to draw slowly away
     from us. Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth
     rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated of the party,
     were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what
     coast we should make for. It was a nice question, for the Cape de
     Verds were about five hundred miles to the north of us, and the
     African coast about seven hundred to the east. On the whole, as the
     wind was coming round to the north, we thought that Sierra Leone
     might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the bark being
     at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as
     we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from
     her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. A few
     seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the
     smoke thinned away there was no sign left of the Gloria Scott. In an
     instant we swept the boat's head round again and pulled with all our
     strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the water
     marked the scene of this catastrophe.

     "'It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared
     that we had come too late to save any one. A splintered boat and a
     number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the
     waves showed us where the vessel had foundered; but there was no sign
     of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for
     help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying
     stretched across it. When we pulled him aboard the boat he proved to
     be a young seaman of the name of Hudson, who was so burned and
     exhausted that he could give us no account of what had happened until
     the following morning.

     "'It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had
     proceeded to put to death the five remaining prisoners. The two
     warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third
     mate. Prendergast then descended into the 'tween-decks and with his
     own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon. There only
     remained the first mate, who was a bold and active man. When he saw
     the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand he
     kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and
     rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. A dozen
     convicts, who descended with their pistols in search of him, found
     him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open powder-barrel,
     which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that he
     would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. An instant
     later the explosion occurred, though Hudson thought it was caused by
     the misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate's
     match. Be the cause what I may, it was the end of the Gloria Scott
     and of the rabble who held command of her.

     "'Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible
     business in which I was involved. Next day we were picked up by the
     brig Hotspur, bound for Australia, whose captain found no difficulty
     in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had
     foundered. The transport ship Gloria Scott was set down by the
     Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to
     her true fate. After an excellent voyage the Hotspur landed us at
     Sydney, where Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the
     diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all nations,
     we had no difficulty in losing our former identities. The rest I need
     not relate. We prospered, we traveled, we came back as rich colonials
     to England, and we bought country estates. For more than twenty years
     we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped that our past was
     forever buried. Imagine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who
     came to us I recognized instantly the man who had been picked off the
     wreck. He had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself to live
     upon our fears. You will understand now how it was that I strove to
     keep the peace with him, and you will in some measure sympathize with
     me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his
     other victim with threats upon his tongue.'

     "Underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible,
     'Beddoes writes in cipher to say H. has told all. Sweet Lord, have
     mercy on our souls!'

     "That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor, and
     I think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one.
     The good fellow was heart-broken at it, and went out to the Terai tea
     planting, where I hear that he is doing well. As to the sailor and
     Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on
     which the letter of warning was written. They both disappeared
     utterly and completely. No complaint had been lodged with the police,
     so that Beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had been
     seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had
     done away with Beddoes and had fled. For myself I believe that the
     truth was exactly the opposite. I think that it is most probable that
     Beddoes, pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been
     already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from
     the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. Those
     are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to your
     collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your service."






                               THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL

     An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend
     Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was
     the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he
     affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in
     his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a
     fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional
     in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan,
     coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made
     me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a
     limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the
     coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and
     his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the
     very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself
     virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should
     be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his
     queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a
     hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with
     a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither
     the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.

     Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics
     which had a way of wandering into unlikely positions, and of turning

Iteration: 13000
     "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "It was a dangerous, reckless
     attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having
     found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to
     be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
     could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was
     much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the
     missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of
     the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it
     into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put
     it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an
     effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that
     they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise
     they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was
     about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by
     the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and
     so changed the conversation."

     "Good heavens!" cried the Colonel, laughing, "do you mean to say all
     our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?"

     "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," cried I, looking in
     amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new
     phase of his astuteness.

     "It is an art which is often useful," said he. "When I recovered I
     managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of
     ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that
     I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper."

     "Oh, what an ass I have been!" I exclaimed.

     "I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,"
     said Holmes, laughing. "I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
     which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and
     having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind
     the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their
     attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I
     had hardly got the paper, however--which was, as I had expected, in
     one of them--when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
     believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and
     friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat
     now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get
     the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you
     see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair
     made them perfectly desperate.

     "I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive
     of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
     demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could
     done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do
     everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two
     it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You'll dine with
     perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange
     dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of
     nothing, Watson. That she is already dead is a very likely

     that he was indeed with us. Then I recalled to mind that he had
     of this man Porlock."

     By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was
     seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and
     that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold,
     and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only
     his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most
     fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar
     instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a
     hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn
     sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced
     at it, and then handed it to me.

     "You see," he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.

     In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, "The
     sign of the four."

     "In God's name, what does it all mean?" I asked.

     "It means murder," said he, stooping over the dead man. "Ah, I
     expected it. Look here!" He pointed to what looked like a long, dark
     thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.

     "It looks like a thorn," said I.

     "It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is
     poisoned."

     I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin
     so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of
     blood showed where the puncture had been.

     "This is all an insoluble mystery to me," said I. "It grows darker
     instead of clearer."

     "On the contrary," he answered, "it clears every instant. I only
     require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case."

     We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the
     chamber. He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of
     terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,
     he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.

     "The treasure is gone!" he said. "They have robbed him of the
     treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him
     to do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last
     the basis of the deduction.  The same may be said, my dear fellow,
     for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     this, that you may know straight from me how far I have been to
     terrified child.

     It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those
     who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see
     Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face
     was beautifully flushed with her exertions, and she held her hand to
     her side.

     "I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson," said
     she. "I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my
     brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the
     stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please
     forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you."

     "But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton," said I. "I am Sir Henry's
     a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for
     vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the
     weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which
     haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through
     Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot
     stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please
     him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and
     which, fortunately, she is too innocent to understand. On one
     straightened himself out and burst into a hearty fit of laughter.

     "Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,"
     revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never
     faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked
     the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and had
     that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself,
     pacing up and down the platform, his tall, gaunt figure made even
     of his arrival he became very much the worse for drink, and, indeed,
     Watson, come round and lunch with us at two. I'll be able to tell you
     Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of
     down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It
     into your theory?"

     We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library
     where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early
     likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue
     sealed forever in death. In either case the time for suppression is
     past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I
     swear as I hope for mercy.

     "'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my
     younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me
     a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which
     seemed to imply that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was
     that I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage I was
     convicted of breaking my country's laws, and was sentenced to
     transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
     debt of honor, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money which
     was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it
     before there could be any possibility of its being missed. But the
     most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had reckoned
     upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts
     exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with,
     but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than
     now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a
     felon with thirty-seven other convicts in 'tween-decks of the bark
     Gloria Scott, bound for Australia.

     "'It was the year '55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the
     old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black
     Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less
     suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. The Gloria Scott
     had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
     heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her
     out. She was a five-hundred-ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight
     jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a
     captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly
     a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from
     Falmouth.

     "'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being
     of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and
     frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had
     particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a young
     man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather
     nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a
     swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for
     his extraordinary height. I don't think any of our heads would have
     come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have
     measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many
     sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and
     resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I
     was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still
     when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear,
     and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which
     separated us.

     "'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here
     for?"

     "'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.

     "'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and by God! You'll learn to bless
     my name before you've done with me."

     "'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an
     immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own
     arrest. He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of
     incurably vicious habits, who had, by an ingenious system of fraud,
     obtained huge sums of money from the leading London merchants.

     "'"Ha, ha! You remember my case!" said he proudly.

     "You know the story of the hound?"

     "I do not believe in such nonsense."

     "But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away
     from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is
     wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?"

     "Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature. I
     fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than
     this it would be impossible to get him to move."

     Holmes shook his head mournfully.

     "You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be
     war?"

     "I think it is very probable."

     "Then, sir, prepare for war."

     "Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what
     has happened, and of what remains to be done."

     "I was sleepy before you came.  I am quite wakeful now."

     "I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting
     anything vital to the case.  It is conceivable that you may even have
     read some account of the matter.  It is the supposed murder of
     Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am
     investigating."

     "I have heard nothing of it."

     "It has not excited much attention yet, except locally.  The facts
     are only two days old.  Briefly they are these:

     "The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish
     regiments in the British army.  It did wonders both in the Crimea and
     the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every
     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James
     Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
     to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
     so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a
     musket.

     "Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and
     his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
     a former color-sergeant in the same corps.  There was, therefore, as
     can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple
     (for they were still young) found themselves in their new
     surroundings.  They appear, however, to have quickly adapted
     themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
     popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his
     brother officers.  I may add that she was a woman of great beauty,
     and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty
     years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy
     one.  Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that
     he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.  On the
     whole, he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than
     his wife's to Barclay.  He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from
     her for a day.  She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful,
     was less obtrusively affectionate.  But they were regarded in the
     regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.  There was
     absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for
     the tragedy which was to follow.

     "I have brought something better than news," said I, putting down the
     box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my
     heart was heavy within me. "I have brought you something which is
     worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune."

     She glanced at iron box. "Is that the treasure, then?" she asked,
     coolly enough.

     "Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half
     is Thaddeus Sholto's. You will have a couple of hundred thousand
     each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be
     few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?"

     I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that
     she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her
     eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.

     "If I have it," said she, "I owe it to you."

     "No, no," I answered, "not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
     With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue
     which has taxed even his analytical genius.  As it was, we very
     nearly lost it at the last moment."

     "Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson," said she.

     I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her
     last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora,
     the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and
     the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and
     shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the
     dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I
     feared that she was about to faint.

     "It is nothing," she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.
     "I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed
     my friends in such horrible peril."

     "That is all over," I answered. "It was nothing. I will tell you no
     more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the
     treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it
     with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see
     it."

     "It would be of the greatest interest to me," she said. There was no
     eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that
     it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize
     which had cost so much to win.

     "What a pretty box!" she said, stooping over it. "This is Indian
     work, I suppose?"

     "Yes; it is Benares metal-work."

     "And so heavy!" she exclaimed, trying to raise it. "The box alone
     must be of some value. Where is the key?"

     "Small threw it into the Thames," I answered. "I must borrow Mrs.
     Forrester's poker." There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,
     wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end
     of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open
     with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We
     both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!

     No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch
     thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest
     constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or
     crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and
     completely empty.

     "The treasure is lost," said Miss Morstan, calmly.

     As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great
     shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra
     treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.
     It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize
     nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. "Thank
     God!" I ejaculated from my very heart.

     She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. "Why do you say
     that?" she asked.

     "Because you are within my reach again," I said, taking her hand. She
     did not withdraw it. "Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a
     man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my
     lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is
     why I said, 'Thank God.'"

     "Then I say, 'Thank God,' too," she whispered, as I drew her to my
     side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had
     gained one.





          CHAPTER XII
          The Strange Story of Jonathan Small


     A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary
     time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him
     the empty box.

     "There goes the reward!" said he, gloomily. "Where there is no money
     there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner
     each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there."

     "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man," I said. "He will see that you
     are rewarded, treasure or no."

     The inspector shook his head despondently, however. "It's a bad job,"
     he repeated; "and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think."

     His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank
     enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They
     had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had
     changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon
     the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual
     listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with
     his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty
     box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.

     "This is your doing, Small," said Athelney Jones, angrily.

     "Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it," he
     cried, exultantly. "It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot
     I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no
     living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the
     Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have
     the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through
     for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us
     always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have
     done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to
     kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich
     that we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is,
     and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us,
     I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this
     over spilled milk."

     "This is a very serious matter, Small," said the detective. "If you
     had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would
     have had a better chance at your trial."

     "Justice!" snarled the ex-convict. "A pretty justice! Whose loot is
     to tell. The visitor of the night before was not a gentleman, neither
     London do not present a more dreadful record of sin than does the

     who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir.
     individual.  You know my methods, Watson.  There was not one of them
     policeman enrolled himself among his customers.

     "'Would you murder me?' he stammered.

     "No, thank goodness, she did not."

     "We are doing so," Holmes interrupted. "All that I am saying has a
     heads than yours or mine," he remarked, and bowing in a stately,
     old-fashioned manner he departed.

     "Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it," he
     cried, exultantly. "It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot
     I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no
     living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the
     Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have
     the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through
     walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime,
     the house without the girl's knowledge, and the plaster over the face
     handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his
     the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through
     who had betrayed them.

     I shook my head. "Many men have been hanged on far slighter
     evidence," I remarked.

     "Of course not. I quite understand that."

     "No, sir; one theatre party came in late. No one else."

     "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
     Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that
     takes so much interest in my affairs?"

     "What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
     nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"

     "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
     that the business is supernatural."

     "What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply. "It seems to me that all
     you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."

     "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
     I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will confine ourselves
     for the present with your permission to this very interesting
     document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday
     evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"

     "It is here in the corner."

     "Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the
     leading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up
     and down the columns. "Capital article this on free trade. Permit me
     to give you an extract from it.

     "'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or
     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it
     stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
     wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower
     the general conditions of life in this island.'

     "What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee,
     rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think that

                            The Tragedy of Birlstone





          CHAPTER I
          The Warning


     "I am inclined to think--" said I.

     "I should do so," Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.

     I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but
     I'll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.

     "Really, Holmes," said I severely, "you are a little trying at
     times."

     He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate
     answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted
     breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had
     just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held
     it up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and
     the flap.

     "It is Porlock's writing," said he thoughtfully. "I can hardly doubt
     that it is Porlock's writing, though I have seen it only twice
     before. The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive.
     But if it is Porlock, then it must be something of the very first
     importance."

     He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation
     disappeared in the interest which the words awakened.

     "Who then is Porlock?" I asked.

     "Porlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but
     behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter
     he frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me
     ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city.
     Porlock is important, not for himself, but for the great man with
     whom he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the
     shark, the jackal with the lion--anything that is insignificant in
     companionship with what is formidable: not only formidable, Watson,
     but sinister--in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes
     within my purview. You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?"

     "The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as--"

     "My blushes, Watson!" Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.

     "I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public."

     "A touch! A distinct touch!" cried Holmes. "You are developing a
     certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must
     learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are
     uttering libel in the eyes of the law--and there lie the glory and
     the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of
     every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain
     which might have made or marred the destiny of nations--that's the
     man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from
     criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that
     for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a
     court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his
     wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of
     an Asteroid, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure
     mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific
     press capable of criticizing it? Is this a man to traduce?
     Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor--such would be your
     respective roles! That's genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser
     men, our day will surely come."

     "May I be there to see!" I exclaimed devoutly. "But you were speaking
     of this man Porlock."

     "Ah, yes--the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little
     way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound
     link--between ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as
     I have been able to test it."

     "But no chain is stronger than its weakest link."

     "Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock.
     Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged
     by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to
     him by devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance
     information which has been of value--that highest value which
     anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt
     that, if we had the cipher, we should find that this communication is
     of the nature that I indicate."

     Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose
     and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which
     ran as follows:

                         534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41
                         DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE
                              26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171

     "What do you make of it, Holmes?"

     "It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information."

     "But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?"

     "In this instance, none at all."

     "Why do you say 'in this instance'?"

     "Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do
     the apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the
     intelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is
     clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am
     told which page and which book I am powerless."

     "But why 'Douglas' and 'Birlstone'?"

     "Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page
     in question."

     "Then why has he not indicated the book?"

     "Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is
     the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing
     cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are
     undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from
     it. Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it
     does not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is
     more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer."

     Holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the
     appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were
     expecting.

     "The same writing," remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, "and
     actually signed," he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the
     epistle. "Come, we are getting on, Watson." His brow clouded,
     however, as he glanced over the contents.

     "Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our
     expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come
     to no harm.

     "Dear Mr. Holmes [he says]:
     "I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous--he
     suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite
     unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the
     intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover
     it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read
     suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now
     be of no use to you.
     "Fred Porlock."

     Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his
     fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.

     "After all," he said at last, "there may be nothing in it. It may be
     only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may
     have read the accusation in the other's eyes."

     "The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty."

     "No less! When any of that party talk about 'He' you know whom they
     mean. There is one predominant 'He' for all of them."

     "But what can he do?"

     "Hum! That's a large question. When you have one of the first brains
     of Europe up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back,
     there are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently
     scared out of his senses--kindly compare the writing in the note to
     that upon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this
     ill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly
     legible."

     "Why did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?"

     "Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case,
     and possibly bring trouble on him."

     "No doubt," said I. "Of course." I had picked up the original cipher
     message and was bending my brows over it. "It's pretty maddening to
     think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper,
     and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it."

     Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the
     unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. "I
     wonder!" said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. "Perhaps
     there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let
     us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man's
     reference is to a book. That is our point of departure."

     "A somewhat vague one."

     "Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon
     it, it seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to
     this book?"

     "None."

     "Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher
     message begins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a
     working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the
     cipher refers. So our book has already become a large book which is
     surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the
     nature of this large book? The next sign is C2. What do you make of
     that, Watson?"

     "Chapter the second, no doubt."

     "Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the
     page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if
     page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first
     one must have been really intolerable."

     "Column!" I cried.

     "Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not
     column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to
     visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a
     considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the
     document as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the
     limits of what reason can supply?"

     "I fear that we have."

     "Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear
     Watson--yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one,
     he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before
     his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says
     so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one
     which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He
     had it--and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson,
     it is a very common book."

     "What you say certainly sounds plausible."

     "So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed
     in double columns and in common use."

     "The Bible!" I cried triumphantly.

     "Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough!
     Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any
     volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of
     Moriarty's associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so
     numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the
     same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He
     knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page
     534."

     "But very few books would correspond with that."

     "Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to
     standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess."

     "Bradshaw!"

     "There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is
     nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly
     lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate
     Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same
     reason. What then is left?"

     "An almanac!"

     "Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched
     the spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's
     Almanac. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages.
     It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it
     becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end." He
     picked the volume from his desk. "Here is page 534, column two, a
     substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and
     resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number
     thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning.
     Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'Government'; which at least
     makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor
     Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do?
     Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are undone, my good
     Watson! It is finished!"

     He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy
     eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless
     and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a
     sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which
     he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.

     "We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!" he cried. "We
     are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the
     seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It
     is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one.
     No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been
     written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number
     thirteen is 'There,' which is much more promising. Number one hundred
     and twenty-seven is 'is'--'There is'"--Holmes's eyes were gleaming
     with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted
     the words--"'danger.' Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. 'There
     is danger-- may-- come-- very-- soon-- one.' Then we have the name
     'Douglas' --'rich-- country-- now-- at-- Birlstone-- House--
     Birlstone-- confidence-- is-- pressing.' There, Watson! What do you
     think of pure reason and its fruit? If the greengrocer had such a
     thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it."

     I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he
     deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.

     "What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!" said I.

     "On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well," said Holmes.
     "When you search a single column for words with which to express your
     meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are
     bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent.
     The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one
     Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country
     gentleman. He is sure--'confidence' was as near as he could get to
     'confident'--that it is pressing. There is our result--and a very
     workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!"

     Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work,
     even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which
     he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung
     open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered
     into the room.

     Those were the early days at the end of the '80's, when Alec
     MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has
     now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective
     force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been
     entrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional
     physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous
     eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled
     out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with
     a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.

     Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success,
     his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For
     this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his
     amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness
     with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows
     nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius,
     and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to
     perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of
     one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his
     experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant
     of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.

     "You are an early bird, Mr. Mac," said he. "I wish you luck with your
     worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot."

     "If you said 'hope' instead of 'fear,' it would be nearer the truth,
     I'm thinking, Mr. Holmes," the inspector answered, with a knowing
     grin. "Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill.
     No, I won't smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way;
     for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows
     better than your own self. But--but--"

     The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of
     absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon
     which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.

     "Douglas!" he stammered. "Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man,
     it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
     get those names?"

     "It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But
     why--what's amiss with the names?"

     The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed
     astonishment. "Just this," said he, "that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone
     Manor House was horribly murdered last night!"





          CHAPTER II
          Sherlock Holmes Discourses


     It was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed. It
     would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited
     by the amazing announcement. Without having a tinge of cruelty in his
     singular composition, he was undoubtedly callous from long
     over-stimulation. Yet, if his emotions were dulled, his intellectual
     perceptions were exceedingly active. There was no trace then of the
     horror which I had myself felt at this curt declaration; but his face
     showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who
     sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated
     solution.

     "Remarkable!" said he. "Remarkable!"

     "You don't seem surprised."

     "Interested, Mr. Mac, but hardly surprised. Why should I be
     surprised? I receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which
     I know to be important, warning me that danger threatens a certain
     person. Within an hour I learn that this danger has actually
     materialized and that the person is dead. I am interested; but, as
     you observe, I am not surprised."

     In a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts
     about the letter and the cipher. MacDonald sat with his chin on his
     hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle.

     "I was going down to Birlstone this morning," said he. "I had come to
     ask you if you cared to come with me--you and your friend here. But
     from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in London."

     "I rather think not," said Holmes.

     "Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!" cried the inspector. "The papers will be
     full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where's the
     mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before
     ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the
     rest will follow."

     "No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the
     so-called Porlock?"

     MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. "Posted
     in Camberwell--that doesn't help us much. Name, you say, is assumed.
     Not much to go on, certainly. Didn't you say that you have sent him
     money?"

     "Twice."

     "And how?"

     "In notes to Camberwell post-office."

     "Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?"

     "No."

     The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. "Why not?"

     "Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that
     I would not try to trace him."

     "You think there is someone behind him?"

     "I know there is."

     "This professor that I've heard you mention?"

     "Exactly!"

     Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced
     towards me. "I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in
     the C. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over
     this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He
     seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man."

     "I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent."

     "Man, you can't but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it
     my business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the
     talk got that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern
     and a globe, and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book;
     but I don't mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had
     a good Aberdeen upbringing. He'd have made a grand meenister with his
     thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put
     his hand on my shoulder as we were parting, it was like a father's
     blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world."

     Holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands. "Great!" he said. "Great! Tell
     me, Friend MacDonald, this pleasing and touching interview was, I
     suppose, in the professor's study?"

     "That's so."

     "A fine room, is it not?"

     "Very fine--very handsome indeed, Mr. Holmes."

     "You sat in front of his writing desk?"

     "Just so."

     "Sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow?"

     "Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my
     face."

     "It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the
     professor's head?"

     "I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I
     saw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at
     you sideways."

     "That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze."


Iteration: 15000
     "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "It was a dangerous, reckless
     attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having
     found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to
     be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
     could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was
     much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the
     missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of
     the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it
     into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put
     it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an
     effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that
     they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise
     they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was
     about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by
     the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and
     so changed the conversation."

     "Good heavens!" cried the Colonel, laughing, "do you mean to say all
     our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?"

     "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," cried I, looking in
     amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new
     phase of his astuteness.

     "It is an art which is often useful," said he. "When I recovered I
     managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of
     ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that
     I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper."

     "Oh, what an ass I have been!" I exclaimed.

     "I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,"
     said Holmes, laughing. "I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
     which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and
     having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind
     the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their
     attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I
     had hardly got the paper, however--which was, as I had expected, in
     one of them--when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
     believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and
     friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat
     now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get
     the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you
     see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair
     made them perfectly desperate.

     "I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive
     of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
     demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could
     have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against
     him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of
     everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two
     masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr. Acton's, and
     having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of
     exposure, to levy black-mail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a
     dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of
     positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was
     convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid
     of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had
     they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention
     to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion
     might never have been aroused."

     "And the note?" I asked.

     Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.

     [ Picture: Paper which reads: If you will only come around at quarter
     to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much
     surprise you and may be of the greatest service to you and also to
     Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone upon the matter ]

     "It is very much the sort of thing that I expected," said he. "Of
     course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between
     Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The results
     shows that the trap was skillfully baited. I am sure that you cannot
     fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p's and
     in the tails of the g's. The absence of the i-dots in the old man's
     writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest
     in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly
     return much invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow." 






                                 THE CROOKED MAN

     One summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my
     own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day's
     work had been an exhausting one.  My wife had already gone upstairs,
     and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told
     me that the servants had also retired.  I had risen from my seat and
     was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang
     of the bell.

     I looked at the clock.  It was a quarter to twelve.  This could not
     be a visitor at so late an hour.  A patient, evidently, and possibly
     an all-night sitting.  With a wry face I went out into the hall and
     opened the door.  To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood
     upon my step.

     "Ah, Watson," said he, "I hoped that I might not be too late to catch
     you."

     "My dear fellow, pray come in."

     "You look surprised, and no wonder!  Relieved, too, I fancy!  Hum! 
     You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then! 
     There's no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat.  It's easy to
     tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson.  You'll
     never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of
     carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve.  Could you put me up
     tonight?"

     "With pleasure."

     "You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that
     you have no gentleman visitor at present.  Your hat-stand proclaims
     as much."

     "I shall be delighted if you will stay."

     "Thank you.  I'll fill the vacant peg then.  Sorry to see that you've
     had the British workman in the house.  He's a token of evil.  Not the
     drains, I hope?"

     "No, the gas."

     "Ah!  He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum
     just where the light strikes it.  No, thank you, I had some supper at
     Waterloo, but I'll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure."

     I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and
     smoked for some time in silence.  I was well aware that nothing but
     business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour,
     so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.

     "I see that you are professionally rather busy just now," said he,
     glancing very keenly across at me.

     "Yes, I've had a busy day," I answered.  "It may seem very foolish in
     your eyes," I added, "but really I don't know how you deduced it."

     Holmes chuckled to himself.

     "I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson," said
     he.  "When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long
     one you use a hansom.  As I perceive that your boots, although used,
     are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy
     enough to justify the hansom."

     "Excellent!" I cried.

     "Elementary," said he.  "It is one of those instances where the
     reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
     neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little point which is
     the basis of the deduction.  The same may be said, my dear fellow,
     for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted
     to the reader.  Now, at present I am in the position of these same
     readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the
     strangest cases which ever perplexed a man's brain, and yet I lack
     the one or two which are needful to complete my theory.  But I'll
     have them, Watson, I'll have them!"  His eyes kindled and a slight
     flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant the veil had lifted
     upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. When I
     glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which
     had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.

     "The problem presents features of interest," said he.  "I may even
     say exceptional features of interest.  I have already looked into the
     matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution.  If
     you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable
     service to me."

     "I should be delighted."

     "Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?"

     "I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice."

     "Very good.  I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo."

     "That would give me time."

     "Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what
     has happened, and of what remains to be done."

     "I was sleepy before you came.  I am quite wakeful now."

     "I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting
     anything vital to the case.  It is conceivable that you may even have
     read some account of the matter.  It is the supposed murder of
     Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am
     investigating."

     "I have heard nothing of it."

     "It has not excited much attention yet, except locally.  The facts
     are only two days old.  Briefly they are these:

     "The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish
     regiments in the British army.  It did wonders both in the Crimea and
     the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every
     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James
     Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
     to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
     so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a
     musket.

     "Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and
     his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
     a former color-sergeant in the same corps.  There was, therefore, as
     can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple
     (for they were still young) found themselves in their new
     surroundings.  They appear, however, to have quickly adapted
     themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
     popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his
     brother officers.  I may add that she was a woman of great beauty,
     and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty
     years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy
     one.  Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that
     he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.  On the
     whole, he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than
     his wife's to Barclay.  He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from
     her for a day.  She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful,
     was less obtrusively affectionate.  But they were regarded in the
     regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.  There was
     absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for
     the tragedy which was to follow.

     "Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in
     his character.  He was a dashing, jovial old solder in his usual
     mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself
     capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness.  This side of
     his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his
     wife.  Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and three out of
     five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular
     sort of depression which came upon him at times.  As the major
     expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if
     by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gaieties and
     chaff of the mess-table.  For days on end, when the mood was on him,
     he has been sunk in the deepest gloom.  This and a certain tinge of
     superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his
     brother officers had observed.  The latter peculiarity took the form
     of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark.  This
     puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often
     given rise to comment and conjecture.

     "The first battalion of the Royal Munsters (which is the old 117th)
     has been stationed at Aldershot for some years.  The married officers
     live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time
     occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the north
     camp.  The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it
     is not more than thirty yards from the high-road.  A coachman and two
     maids form the staff of servants.  These with their master and
     mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no
     children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.

     "Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of
     last Monday.

     "Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church,
     and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the
     Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt
     Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off
     clothing.  A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at
     eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be
     present at it.  When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman
     to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him
     that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss
     Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went
     off together to their meeting.  It lasted forty minutes, and at a
     quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss
     Morrison at her door as she passed.

     "There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine.  This
     faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the
     lawn.  The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the
     highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it.  It was into this
     room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return.  The blinds were not
     down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay
     herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the
     house-maid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to
     her usual habits.  The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room,
     but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the
     morning-room.  The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it.  He
     was never seen again alive.

     "The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten
     minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to
     hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. 
     She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle,
     but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.  Naturally
     enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the
     coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was
     still raging.  They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard,
     those of Barclay and of his wife.  Barclay's remarks were subdued and
     abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners.  The
     lady's, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her
     voice could be plainly heard.  'You coward!' she repeated over and
     over again.  'What can be done now?  What can be done now?  Give me
     back my life.  I will never so much as breathe the same air with you
     again!  You coward!  You Coward!'  Those were scraps of her
     conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man's voice,
     with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman.  Convinced that
     some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove
     to force it, while scream after scream issued from within.  He was
     unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too
     distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him.  A sudden
     thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and
     round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open.  One side
     of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the
     summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room.  His
     mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a
     couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-chair, and
     his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the
     unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.

     "Naturally, the coachman's first thought, on finding that he could do
     nothing for his master, was to open the door.  But here an unexpected
     and singular difficulty presented itself.  The key was not in the
     inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. 
     He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained
     the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned.  The lady,
     against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to
     her room, still in a state of insensibility.  The Colonel's body was
     then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the
     scene of the tragedy.

     "The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was
     found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his
     head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt
     weapon.  Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have
     been.  Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club
     of hard carved wood with a bone handle.  The Colonel possessed a
     varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in
     which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that his
     club was among his trophies.  The servants deny having seen it
     before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is
     possible that it may have been overlooked.  Nothing else of
     importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the
     inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay's person nor upon
     that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to
     be found.  The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from
     Aldershot.

     "That was the state of things, Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning
     I, at the request of Major Murphy, went down to Aldershot to
     supplement the efforts of the police.  I think that you will
     acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my
     observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more
     extraordinary than would at first sight appear.

     "Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only
     succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated.  One
     other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the
     housemaid.  You will remember that on hearing the sound of the
     quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants.  On that
     first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her
     master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly
     anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they
     had fallen out.  On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she
     heard the word David uttered twice by the lady.  The point is of the
     utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden
     quarrel.  The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.

     "There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest
     impression both upon the servants and the police.  This was the
     contortion of the Colonel's face.  It had set, according to their
     account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a
     human countenance is capable of assuming.  More than one person
     fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect.  It was
     quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused
     him the utmost horror.  This, of course, fitted in well enough with
     the police theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a
     murderous attack upon him.  Nor was the fact of the wound being on
     the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have
     turned to avoid the blow.  No information could be got from the lady
     herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of
     brain-fever.

     "From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember went
     out that evening with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge of
     what it was which had caused the ill-humor in which her companion had
     returned.

     "Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over
     them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which
     were merely incidental.  There could be no question that the most
     distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular
     disappearance of the door-key.  A most careful search had failed to
     discover it in the room.  Therefore it must have been taken from it. 
     But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel's wife could have taken it. 
     That was perfectly clear.  Therefore a third person must have entered
     the room.  And that third person could only have come in through the
     window.  It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and
     the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious
     individual.  You know my methods, Watson.  There was not one of them
     which I did not apply to the inquiry.  And it ended by my discovering
     traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected. 
     There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming
     from the road.  I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of
     his foot-marks:  one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had
     climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon
     the stained boards near the window where he had entered.  He had
     apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper
     than his heels.  But it was not the man who surprised me.  It was his
     companion."

     "His companion!"

     Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and
     carefully unfolded it upon his knee.

     "What do you make of that?" he asked.

     The paper was covered with the tracings of the foot-marks of some
     small animal.  It had five well-marked foot-pads, an indication of
     long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as  a
     dessert-spoon.

     "It's a dog," said I.

     "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?  I found distinct
     traces that this creature had done so."

     "A monkey, then?"

     "But it is not the print of a monkey."

     "What can it be, then?"

     "Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar
     with.  I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements.  Here
     are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless.  You
     see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. 
     Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not
     much less than two feet long--probably more if there is any tail. 
     But now observe this other measurement.  The animal has been moving,
     and we have the length of its stride.  In each case it is only about
     three inches.  You have an indication, you see, of a long body with
     very short legs attached to it.  It has not been considerate enough
     to leave any of its hair behind it.  But its general shape must be
     what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is
     carnivorous."

     "How do you deduce that?"

     "Because it ran up the curtain.  A canary's cage was hanging in the
     window, and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird."

     "Then what was the beast?"

     "Ah, if I could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving
     the case.  On the whole, it was probably some creature of the weasel
     and stoat tribe--and yet it is larger than any of these that I have
     seen."

     "But what had it to do with the crime?"

     "That, also, is still obscure.  But we have learned a good deal, you
     perceive.  We know that a man stood in the road looking at the
     quarrel between the Barclays--the blinds were up and the room
     lighted.  We know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the
     room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the
     Colonel or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down from
     sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of
     the fender.  Finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder
     carried away the key with him when he left."

     "Your discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure that it
     was before," said I.

     "Quite so.  They undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper
     than was at first conjectured.  I thought the matter over, and I came
     to the conclusion that I must approach the case from another aspect. 
     But really, Watson, I am keeping you up, and I might just as well
     tell you all this on our way to Aldershot to-morrow."

     "Thank you, you have gone rather too far to stop."

     "It is quite certain that when Mrs. Barclay left the house at
     half-past seven she was on good terms with her husband.  She was
     never, as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she
     was heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel in a friendly
     fashion.  Now, it was equally certain that, immediately on her
     return, she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see
     her husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman will, and finally,
     on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. 
     Therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine
     o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him.  But

                            The Tragedy of Birlstone





          CHAPTER I
          The Warning


     "I am inclined to think--" said I.

     "I should do so," Sherlock Holmes remarked impatiently.

     I believe that I am one of the most long-suffering of mortals; but
     I'll admit that I was annoyed at the sardonic interruption.

     "Really, Holmes," said I severely, "you are a little trying at
     times."

     He was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate
     answer to my remonstrance. He leaned upon his hand, with his untasted
     breakfast before him, and he stared at the slip of paper which he had
     just drawn from its envelope. Then he took the envelope itself, held
     it up to the light, and very carefully studied both the exterior and
     the flap.

     "It is Porlock's writing," said he thoughtfully. "I can hardly doubt
     that it is Porlock's writing, though I have seen it only twice
     before. The Greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive.
     But if it is Porlock, then it must be something of the very first
     importance."

     He was speaking to himself rather than to me; but my vexation
     disappeared in the interest which the words awakened.

     "Who then is Porlock?" I asked.

     "Porlock, Watson, is a nom-de-plume, a mere identification mark; but
     behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality. In a former letter
     he frankly informed me that the name was not his own, and defied me
     ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city.
     Porlock is important, not for himself, but for the great man with
     whom he is in touch. Picture to yourself the pilot fish with the
     shark, the jackal with the lion--anything that is insignificant in
     companionship with what is formidable: not only formidable, Watson,
     but sinister--in the highest degree sinister. That is where he comes
     within my purview. You have heard me speak of Professor Moriarty?"

     "The famous scientific criminal, as famous among crooks as--"

     "My blushes, Watson!" Holmes murmured in a deprecating voice.

     "I was about to say, as he is unknown to the public."

     "A touch! A distinct touch!" cried Holmes. "You are developing a
     certain unexpected vein of pawky humour, Watson, against which I must
     learn to guard myself. But in calling Moriarty a criminal you are
     uttering libel in the eyes of the law--and there lie the glory and
     the wonder of it! The greatest schemer of all time, the organizer of
     every deviltry, the controlling brain of the underworld, a brain
     which might have made or marred the destiny of nations--that's the
     man! But so aloof is he from general suspicion, so immune from
     criticism, so admirable in his management and self-effacement, that
     for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a
     court and emerge with your year's pension as a solatium for his
     wounded character. Is he not the celebrated author of The Dynamics of
     an Asteroid, a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure
     mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific
     press capable of criticizing it? Is this a man to traduce?
     Foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor--such would be your
     respective roles! That's genius, Watson. But if I am spared by lesser
     men, our day will surely come."

     "May I be there to see!" I exclaimed devoutly. "But you were speaking
     of this man Porlock."

     "Ah, yes--the so-called Porlock is a link in the chain some little
     way from its great attachment. Porlock is not quite a sound
     link--between ourselves. He is the only flaw in that chain so far as
     I have been able to test it."

     "But no chain is stronger than its weakest link."

     "Exactly, my dear Watson! Hence the extreme importance of Porlock.
     Led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right, and encouraged
     by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to
     him by devious methods, he has once or twice given me advance
     information which has been of value--that highest value which
     anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime. I cannot doubt
     that, if we had the cipher, we should find that this communication is
     of the nature that I indicate."

     Again Holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate. I rose
     and, leaning over him, stared down at the curious inscription, which
     ran as follows:

                         534 C2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41
                         DOUGLAS 109 293 5 37 BIRLSTONE
                              26 BIRLSTONE 9 47 171

     "What do you make of it, Holmes?"

     "It is obviously an attempt to convey secret information."

     "But what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher?"

     "In this instance, none at all."

     "Why do you say 'in this instance'?"

     "Because there are many ciphers which I would read as easily as I do
     the apocrypha of the agony column: such crude devices amuse the
     intelligence without fatiguing it. But this is different. It is
     clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book. Until I am
     told which page and which book I am powerless."

     "But why 'Douglas' and 'Birlstone'?"

     "Clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page
     in question."

     "Then why has he not indicated the book?"

     "Your native shrewdness, my dear Watson, that innate cunning which is
     the delight of your friends, would surely prevent you from inclosing
     cipher and message in the same envelope. Should it miscarry, you are
     undone. As it is, both have to go wrong before any harm comes from
     it. Our second post is now overdue, and I shall be surprised if it
     does not bring us either a further letter of explanation, or, as is
     more probable, the very volume to which these figures refer."

     Holmes's calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the
     appearance of Billy, the page, with the very letter which we were
     expecting.

     "The same writing," remarked Holmes, as he opened the envelope, "and
     actually signed," he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the
     epistle. "Come, we are getting on, Watson." His brow clouded,
     however, as he glanced over the contents.

     "Dear me, this is very disappointing! I fear, Watson, that all our
     expectations come to nothing. I trust that the man Porlock will come
     to no harm.

     "Dear Mr. Holmes [he says]:
     "I will go no further in this matter. It is too dangerous--he
     suspects me. I can see that he suspects me. He came to me quite
     unexpectedly after I had actually addressed this envelope with the
     intention of sending you the key to the cipher. I was able to cover
     it up. If he had seen it, it would have gone hard with me. But I read
     suspicion in his eyes. Please burn the cipher message, which can now
     be of no use to you.
     "Fred Porlock."

     Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his
     fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.

     "After all," he said at last, "there may be nothing in it. It may be
     only his guilty conscience. Knowing himself to be a traitor, he may
     have read the accusation in the other's eyes."

     "The other being, I presume, Professor Moriarty."

     "No less! When any of that party talk about 'He' you know whom they
     mean. There is one predominant 'He' for all of them."

     "But what can he do?"

     "Hum! That's a large question. When you have one of the first brains
     of Europe up against you, and all the powers of darkness at his back,
     there are infinite possibilities. Anyhow, Friend Porlock is evidently
     scared out of his senses--kindly compare the writing in the note to
     that upon its envelope; which was done, he tells us, before this
     ill-omened visit. The one is clear and firm. The other hardly
     legible."

     "Why did he write at all? Why did he not simply drop it?"

     "Because he feared I would make some inquiry after him in that case,
     and possibly bring trouble on him."

     "No doubt," said I. "Of course." I had picked up the original cipher
     message and was bending my brows over it. "It's pretty maddening to
     think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper,
     and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it."

     Sherlock Holmes had pushed away his untasted breakfast and lit the
     unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations. "I
     wonder!" said he, leaning back and staring at the ceiling. "Perhaps
     there are points which have escaped your Machiavellian intellect. Let
     us consider the problem in the light of pure reason. This man's
     reference is to a book. That is our point of departure."

     "A somewhat vague one."

     "Let us see then if we can narrow it down. As I focus my mind upon
     it, it seems rather less impenetrable. What indications have we as to
     this book?"

     "None."

     "Well, well, it is surely not quite so bad as that. The cipher
     message begins with a large 534, does it not? We may take it as a
     working hypothesis that 534 is the particular page to which the
     cipher refers. So our book has already become a large book which is
     surely something gained. What other indications have we as to the
     nature of this large book? The next sign is C2. What do you make of
     that, Watson?"

     "Chapter the second, no doubt."

     "Hardly that, Watson. You will, I am sure, agree with me that if the
     page be given, the number of the chapter is immaterial. Also that if
     page 534 finds us only in the second chapter, the length of the first
     one must have been really intolerable."

     "Column!" I cried.

     "Brilliant, Watson. You are scintillating this morning. If it is not
     column, then I am very much deceived. So now, you see, we begin to
     visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a
     considerable length, since one of the words is numbered in the
     document as the two hundred and ninety-third. Have we reached the
     limits of what reason can supply?"

     "I fear that we have."

     "Surely you do yourself an injustice. One more coruscation, my dear
     Watson--yet another brain-wave! Had the volume been an unusual one,
     he would have sent it to me. Instead of that, he had intended, before
     his plans were nipped, to send me the clue in this envelope. He says
     so in his note. This would seem to indicate that the book is one
     which he thought I would have no difficulty in finding for myself. He
     had it--and he imagined that I would have it, too. In short, Watson,
     it is a very common book."

     "What you say certainly sounds plausible."

     "So we have contracted our field of search to a large book, printed
     in double columns and in common use."

     "The Bible!" I cried triumphantly.

     "Good, Watson, good! But not, if I may say so, quite good enough!
     Even if I accepted the compliment for myself I could hardly name any
     volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of
     Moriarty's associates. Besides, the editions of Holy Writ are so
     numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the
     same pagination. This is clearly a book which is standardized. He
     knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page
     534."

     "But very few books would correspond with that."

     "Exactly. Therein lies our salvation. Our search is narrowed down to
     standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess."

     "Bradshaw!"

     "There are difficulties, Watson. The vocabulary of Bradshaw is
     nervous and terse, but limited. The selection of words would hardly
     lend itself to the sending of general messages. We will eliminate
     Bradshaw. The dictionary is, I fear, inadmissible for the same
     reason. What then is left?"

     "An almanac!"

     "Excellent, Watson! I am very much mistaken if you have not touched
     the spot. An almanac! Let us consider the claims of Whitaker's
     Almanac. It is in common use. It has the requisite number of pages.
     It is in double column. Though reserved in its earlier vocabulary, it
     becomes, if I remember right, quite garrulous towards the end." He
     picked the volume from his desk. "Here is page 534, column two, a
     substantial block of print dealing, I perceive, with the trade and
     resources of British India. Jot down the words, Watson! Number
     thirteen is 'Mahratta.' Not, I fear, a very auspicious beginning.
     Number one hundred and twenty-seven is 'Government'; which at least
     makes sense, though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and Professor
     Moriarty. Now let us try again. What does the Mahratta government do?
     Alas! the next word is 'pig's-bristles.' We are undone, my good
     Watson! It is finished!"

     He had spoken in jesting vein, but the twitching of his bushy
     eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation. I sat helpless
     and unhappy, staring into the fire. A long silence was broken by a
     sudden exclamation from Holmes, who dashed at a cupboard, from which
     he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand.

     "We pay the price, Watson, for being too up-to-date!" he cried. "We
     are before our time, and suffer the usual penalties. Being the
     seventh of January, we have very properly laid in the new almanac. It
     is more than likely that Porlock took his message from the old one.
     No doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been
     written. Now let us see what page 534 has in store for us. Number
     thirteen is 'There,' which is much more promising. Number one hundred
     and twenty-seven is 'is'--'There is'"--Holmes's eyes were gleaming
     with excitement, and his thin, nervous fingers twitched as he counted
     the words--"'danger.' Ha! Ha! Capital! Put that down, Watson. 'There
     is danger-- may-- come-- very-- soon-- one.' Then we have the name
     'Douglas' --'rich-- country-- now-- at-- Birlstone-- House--
     Birlstone-- confidence-- is-- pressing.' There, Watson! What do you
     think of pure reason and its fruit? If the greengrocer had such a
     thing as a laurel wreath, I should send Billy round for it."

     I was staring at the strange message which I had scrawled, as he
     deciphered it, upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee.

     "What a queer, scrambling way of expressing his meaning!" said I.

     "On the contrary, he has done quite remarkably well," said Holmes.
     "When you search a single column for words with which to express your
     meaning, you can hardly expect to get everything you want. You are
     bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent.
     The purport is perfectly clear. Some deviltry is intended against one
     Douglas, whoever he may be, residing as stated, a rich country
     gentleman. He is sure--'confidence' was as near as he could get to
     'confident'--that it is pressing. There is our result--and a very
     workmanlike little bit of analysis it was!"

     Holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work,
     even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which
     he aspired. He was still chuckling over his success when Billy swung
     open the door and Inspector MacDonald of Scotland Yard was ushered
     into the room.

     Those were the early days at the end of the '80's, when Alec
     MacDonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has
     now achieved. He was a young but trusted member of the detective
     force, who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been
     entrusted to him. His tall, bony figure gave promise of exceptional
     physical strength, while his great cranium and deep-set, lustrous
     eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled
     out from behind his bushy eyebrows. He was a silent, precise man with
     a dour nature and a hard Aberdonian accent.

     Twice already in his career had Holmes helped him to attain success,
     his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem. For
     this reason the affection and respect of the Scotchman for his
     amateur colleague were profound, and he showed them by the frankness
     with which he consulted Holmes in every difficulty. Mediocrity knows
     nothing higher than itself; but talent instantly recognizes genius,
     and MacDonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to
     perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of
     one who already stood alone in Europe, both in his gifts and in his
     experience. Holmes was not prone to friendship, but he was tolerant
     of the big Scotchman, and smiled at the sight of him.

     "You are an early bird, Mr. Mac," said he. "I wish you luck with your
     worm. I fear this means that there is some mischief afoot."

     "If you said 'hope' instead of 'fear,' it would be nearer the truth,
     I'm thinking, Mr. Holmes," the inspector answered, with a knowing
     grin. "Well, maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill.
     No, I won't smoke, I thank you. I'll have to be pushing on my way;
     for the early hours of a case are the precious ones, as no man knows
     better than your own self. But--but--"

     The inspector had stopped suddenly, and was staring with a look of
     absolute amazement at a paper upon the table. It was the sheet upon
     which I had scrawled the enigmatic message.

     "Douglas!" he stammered. "Birlstone! What's this, Mr. Holmes? Man,
     it's witchcraft! Where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
     get those names?"

     "It is a cipher that Dr. Watson and I have had occasion to solve. But
     why--what's amiss with the names?"

     The inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed
     astonishment. "Just this," said he, "that Mr. Douglas of Birlstone
     Manor House was horribly murdered last night!"

     Holmes shook his head mournfully.

     "Hang it all, Mr. Holmes!" cried the inspector. "The papers will be
     full of the Birlstone mystery in a day or two; but where's the
     mystery if there is a man in London who prophesied the crime before
     ever it occurred? We have only to lay our hands on that man, and the
     rest will follow."

     "No doubt, Mr. Mac. But how do you propose to lay your hands on the
     so-called Porlock?"

     MacDonald turned over the letter which Holmes had handed him. "Posted
     in Camberwell--that doesn't help us much. Name, you say, is assumed.
     Not much to go on, certainly. Didn't you say that you have sent him
     money?"

     "Twice."

     "And how?"

     "In notes to Camberwell post-office."

     "Did you ever trouble to see who called for them?"

     "No."

     The inspector looked surprised and a little shocked. "Why not?"

     "Because I always keep faith. I had promised when he first wrote that
     I would not try to trace him."

     "You think there is someone behind him?"

     "I know there is."

     "This professor that I've heard you mention?"

     "Exactly!"

     Inspector MacDonald smiled, and his eyelid quivered as he glanced
     towards me. "I won't conceal from you, Mr. Holmes, that we think in
     the C. I. D. that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over
     this professor. I made some inquiries myself about the matter. He
     seems to be a very respectable, learned, and talented sort of man."

     "I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent."

     "Man, you can't but recognize it! After I heard your view I made it
     my business to see him. I had a chat with him on eclipses. How the
     talk got that way I canna think; but he had out a reflector lantern
     and a globe, and made it all clear in a minute. He lent me a book;
     but I don't mind saying that it was a bit above my head, though I had
     a good Aberdeen upbringing. He'd have made a grand meenister with his
     thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking. When he put
     with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely
     distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else.
     As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should
     blessing before you go out into the cold, cruel world."






          CHAPTER VI
     Morstan back to her home. After the angelic fashion of women, she had
     poisoned."

     "I'm glad you've got so far as to recognize the talent."

     "Well, it was evening; but I mind that the lamp was turned on my
     face."

     "It would be. Did you happen to observe a picture over the
     professor's head?"

     "I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I
     saw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands, peeping at
     you sideways."

     "That painting was by Jean Baptiste Greuze."

     The inspector endeavoured to look interested.

     "Jean Baptiste Greuze," Holmes continued, joining his finger tips and
     leaning well back in his chair, "was a French artist who flourished
     between the years 1750 and 1800. I allude, of course to his working
     career. Modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion
     formed of him by his contemporaries."

     The inspector's eyes grew abstracted. "Hadn't we better--" he said.

     "We are doing so," Holmes interrupted. "All that I am saying has a
     very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the Birlstone
     Mystery. In fact, it may in a sense be called the very centre of it."

     MacDonald smiled feebly, and looked appealingly to me. "Your thoughts
     move a bit too quick for me, Mr. Holmes. You leave out a link or two,
     and I can't get over the gap. What in the whole wide world can be the
     connection between this dead painting man and the affair at
     Birlstone?"

     "All knowledge comes useful to the detective," remarked Holmes. "Even
     the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by Greuze entitled
     La Jeune Fille a l'Agneau fetched one million two hundred thousand
     francs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the Portalis sale may
     start a train of reflection in your mind."

     It was clear that it did. The inspector looked honestly interested.

     "I may remind you," Holmes continued, "that the professor's salary
     can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference. It is
     seven hundred a year."

     "Then how could he buy--"

     "Quite so! How could he?"

     "Ay, that's remarkable," said the inspector thoughtfully. "Talk away,
     Mr. Holmes. I'm just loving it. It's fine!"

     Holmes smiled. He was always warmed by genuine admiration--the
     characteristic of the real artist. "What about Birlstone?" he asked.

                        THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN

     I had intended "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange" to be the last of
     those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever
     communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any
     lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to
     which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest
     on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique
     methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance
     which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his
     experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the
     records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but
     since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to
     study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become
     hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in
     this matter should be strictly observed. It was only upon my
     representing to him that I had given a promise that "The Adventure of
     the Second Stain" should be published when the times were ripe, and
     pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series
     of episodes should culminate in the most important international case
     which he has ever been called upon to handle, that I at last
     succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully-guarded account
     of the incident should at last be laid before the public. If in
     telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the
     public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for
     my reticence.

     It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be
     nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two
     visitors of European fame within the walls of our humble room in
     Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant,
     was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of
     Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of
     middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was
     the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs,
     and the most rising statesman in the country. They sat side by side
     upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their
     worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing
     importance which had brought them. The Premier's thin, blue-veined
     hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and
     his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The
     European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted
     with the seals of his watch-chain.

     "When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o'clock
     this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his
     suggestion that we have both come to you."

     "Have you informed the police?"

     "No, sir," said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner
     for which he was famous. "We have not done so, nor is it possible
     that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run,
     mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to
     avoid."

     "And why, sir?"

     "Because the document in question is of such immense importance that
     its publication might very easily--I might almost say probably--lead
     to European complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to
     say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery
     can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be
     recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it
     is that its contents should be generally known."

     "I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if
     you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document
     disappeared."

     "That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it
     was a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. It
     was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I
     have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace,
     and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last
     night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was
     dressing for dinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it was
     gone. The despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my
     dressing-table all night. I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. We
     are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room
     during the night. And yet I repeat that the paper is gone."

     "What time did you dine?"

     "Half-past seven."

     "How long was it before you went to bed?"

     "My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was
     half-past eleven before we went to our room."

     "Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?"

     "No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in
     the morning, and my valet, or my wife's maid, during the rest of the
     day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some
     time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there
     was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in
     my despatch-box."

     "Who did know of the existence of that letter?"

     "No one in the house."

     "Surely your wife knew?"

     "No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this
     morning."

     The Premier nodded approvingly.

     "I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty," said
     he. "I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance
     it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties."

     The European Secretary bowed.

     "You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never
     breathed one word to my wife upon this matter."

     "Could she have guessed?"

     "No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed--nor could anyone have
     guessed."

     "Have you lost any documents before?"

     "No, sir."

     "Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this
     letter?"

     "Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the
     pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased
     by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good
     heavens, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost
     it!" His handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his
     hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the
     natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the
     aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned.
     "Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three,
     departmental officials who know of the letter. No one else in
     England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you."

     "But abroad?"

     "I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it.
     I am well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official
     channels have not been employed."

     Holmes considered for some little time.

     "Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is,
     and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?"

     The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier's shaggy
     eyebrows gathered in a frown.

     "Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour.
     There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is
     addressed in large, bold handwriting to--"

     "I fear, sir," said Holmes, "that, interesting and indeed essential
     as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of
     things. What was the letter?"

     "That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I
     cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of
     the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an
     envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved
     well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our
     power to bestow."

     Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.

     "You are two of the most busy men in the country," said he, "and in
     my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret
     exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any
     continuation of this interview would be a waste of time."

     The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his
     deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. "I am not
     accustomed, sir--" he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his
     seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old
     statesman shrugged his shoulders.

     "We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and
     it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our
     entire confidence."

     "I agree with you, sir," said the younger statesman.

     "Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of
     your colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for
     I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that
     this affair should come out."

     "You may safely trust us."

     "The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been
     ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It has
     been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.
     Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter.
     At the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and
     certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its
     publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of
     feeling in this country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I
     do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that
     letter this country would be involved in a great war."

     Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the
     Premier.

     "Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter--this letter which may
     well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a
     hundred thousand men--which has become lost in this unaccountable
     fashion."

     "Have you informed the sender?"

     "Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched."

     "Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter."

     "No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already
     understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner.
     It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if
     this letter were to come out."

     "If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out?
     Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?"

     "There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international
     politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no
     difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed
     camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military
     power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into
     war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other
     confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?"

     "Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this
     potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach
     between his country and ours?"

     "Yes, sir."

     "And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of
     an enemy?"

     "To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding
     on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take
     it."

     Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud.
     The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.

     "It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
     is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are
     in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?"

     Holmes shook his head mournfully.

     "You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be
     war?"

     "I think it is very probable."

     "Then, sir, prepare for war."

     "That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes."

     "Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after
     eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife
     were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It
     was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and
     eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it
     evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as
     early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were
     taken at that hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to
     retain it. It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What
     chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our
     reach."

     The Prime Minister rose from the settee.

     "What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the
     matter is indeed out of our hands."

     "Let us presume, for argument's sake, that the document was taken by
     the maid or by the valet--"

     "They are both old and tried servants."

     "I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that
     there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could
     go up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has
     taken it. To whom would the thief take it? To one of several
     international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably
     familiar to me. There are three who may be said to be the heads of
     their profession. I will begin my research by going round and finding
     if each of them is at his post. If one is missing--especially if he
     has disappeared since last night--we will have some indication as to
     where the document has gone."

     "Why should he be missing?" asked the European Secretary. "He would
     take the letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not."

     "I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations
     with the Embassies are often strained."

     The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.

     "I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a
     prize to head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course
     of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all
     our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be
     any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you,
     and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries."

     The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.

     When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in
     silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had
     opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime
     which had occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an
     exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the
     mantelpiece.

     "Yes," said he, "there is no better way of approaching it. The
     situation is desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be
     sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not
     yet passed out of his hands. After all, it is a question of money
     with these fellows, and I have the British Treasury behind me. If
     it's on the market I'll buy it--if it means another penny on the
     income-tax. It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to
     see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the
     other. There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game;
     there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. I will see each
     of them."

     I glanced at my morning paper.

     "Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?"

     "Yes."

     "You will not see him."

     "Why not?"

     "He was murdered in his house last night."

     My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures
     that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely
     I had astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the
     paper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged
     in reading when he rose from his chair:

                              Murder in Westminster
     A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16,
     Godolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of
     eighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey,
     almost in the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament.
     This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by
     Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of
     his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved
     reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country.
     Mr. Lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his
     establishment consists of Mrs. Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and
     of Mitton, his valet. The former retires early and sleeps at the top
     of the house. The valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at
     Hammersmith. From ten o'clock onwards Mr. Lucas had the house to
     himself. What occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but
     at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett, passing along
     Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No. 16 was ajar. He
     knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the front room
     he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without reply. He
     then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in a state of
     wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one
     chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still
     grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He
     had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife
     with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger,
     plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the
     walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime,
     for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the
     room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his
     violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense
     sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.

     "Well, Watson, what do you make of this?" asked Holmes, after a long
     pause.

     "It is an amazing coincidence."

     "A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as
     possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during
     the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The
     odds are enormous against its being coincidence. No figures could
     express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected--must
     be connected. It is for us to find the connection."

     "But now the official police must know all."

     "Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They
     know--and shall know--nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only we know of
     both events, and can trace the relation between them. There is one
     obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions
     against Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes'
     walk from Whitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have
     named live in the extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore, for
     Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a
     message from the European Secretary's household--a small thing, and
     yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove
     essential. Halloa! what have we here?"

     Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes
     glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.

     "Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step
     up," said he.

     A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that
     morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely
     woman in London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest
     daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no
     contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the
     subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite
     head. And yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty
     which would be the first thing to impress the observer. The cheek was
     lovely, but it was paled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it
     was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn
     in an effort after self-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang
     first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in
     the open door.

     "Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Yes, madam, he has been here."

     "Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here." Holmes
     bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.

     "Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you
     will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot
     make any unconditional promise."

     She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the
     window. It was a queenly presence--tall, graceful, and intensely
     womanly.

     "Mr. Holmes," she said, and her white-gloved hands clasped and
     unclasped as she spoke--"I will speak frankly to you in the hope that
     it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete
     confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That
     one is politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing.
     Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our
     house last night. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because
     the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his
     complete confidence. Now it is essential--essential, I say--that I
     should thoroughly understand it. You are the only other person, save
     only these politicians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then,
     Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will
     lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client's
     interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he
     would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his
     complete confidence. What was this paper which was stolen?"

     "Madam, what you ask me is really impossible."

     She groaned and sank her face in her hands.

     "You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to
     keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only
     learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to
     tell what he has withheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom
     you must ask."

     "I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your
     telling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service
     if you would enlighten me on one point."

     "What is it, madam?"

     "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this
     incident?"

     "Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very
     unfortunate effect."

     "Ah!" She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are
     resolved.

     "One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband
     dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that
     terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this
     document."


Iteration: 18000
     "We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the
     Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round
     his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from
     the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him.
     His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the
     greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia,
     which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its
     decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. The
     other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia.
     He has broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his
     track. Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man
     himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the
     fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in
     the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.
     Sherlock Holmes?"

     Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.

     "Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!" he cried. "But I didn't quite
     follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts."

     "The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After
     all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is
     the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am
     gathering all the threads into my hands."

     "And the next stage?"

     "Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
     quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on
     the charge of murder. Will you come with us?"

     "I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can't
     say for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon a
     factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great
     hopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will
     come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the
     heels."

     "In the Italian quarter?"

     "No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him.
     If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I'll promise
     to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be
     done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do
     us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and
     it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You'll dine with
     us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time
     for us to start. In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you
     would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send, and
     it is important that it should go at once."

     Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old
     daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at
     last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said
     nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. For my
     own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had
     traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I could
     not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood clearly
     that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon
     the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick.
     No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act,
     and I could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had
     inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow
     the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not
     surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with
     me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his
     favourite weapon.

     A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
     spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was
     directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed
     with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. In the light
     of a street lamp we read "Laburnum Villa" upon the gate-post of one
     of them. The occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was
     dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single
     blurred circle on to the garden path. The wooden fence which
     separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon
     the inner side, and here it was that we crouched.

     "I fear that you'll have a long wait," Holmes whispered. "We may
     thank our stars that it is not raining. I don't think we can even
     venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it's a two to one chance
     that we get something to pay us for our trouble."

     It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes
     had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular
     fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his
     coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as
     swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it
     whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against
     the black shadow of the house. There was a long pause, during which
     we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our
     ears. The window was being opened. The noise ceased, and again there
     was a long silence. The fellow was making his way into the house. We
     saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he
     sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through
     another blind, and then through another.

     "Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,"
     Lestrade whispered.

     But before we could move the man had emerged again. As he came out
     into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried something
     white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round him. The silence
     of the deserted street reassured him. Turning his back upon us he
     laid down his burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a
     sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. The man was so intent
     upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole
     across the grass plot. With the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his
     back, and an instant later Lestrade and I had him by either wrist and
     the handcuffs had been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a
     hideous, sallow face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at
     us, and I knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we
     had secured.

     But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention.
     Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining
     that which the man had brought from the house. It was a bust of
     Napoleon like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been
     broken into similar fragments. Carefully Holmes held each separate
     shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from any other
     shattered piece of plaster. He had just completed his examination
     when the hall lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the
     house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented
     himself.

     "Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?" said Holmes.

     "Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the note
     which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly what you
     told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited developments.
     Well, I'm very glad to see that you have got the rascal. I hope,
     gentlemen, that you will come in and have some refreshment."

     However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so
     within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four
     upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say; but he
     glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my
     hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We
     stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a search of
     his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath
     knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.

     "That's all right," said Lestrade, as we parted. "Hill knows all
     these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You'll find that my
     theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I'm sure I am
     exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in
     which you laid hands upon him. I don't quite understand it all yet."

     "I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations," said Holmes.
     "Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off,
     and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very
     end. If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o'clock
     to-morrow I think I shall be able to show you that even now you have
     not grasped the entire meaning of this business, which presents some
     features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime.
     If ever I permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems,
     Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of
     the singular adventure of the Napoleonic busts."

     When we met again next evening Lestrade was furnished with much
     information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was
     Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne'er-do-well among
     the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and had
     earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and had
     twice already been in jail--once for a petty theft and once, as we
     had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk
     English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the busts were
     still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon the
     subject; but the police had discovered that these same busts might
     very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in
     this class of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. To all this
     information, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with
     polite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see that
     his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of mingled
     uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to
     assume. At last he started in his chair and his eyes brightened.
     There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we heard steps upon
     the stairs, and an elderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers
     was ushered in. In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned
     carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.

     "Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?"

     My friend bowed and smiled. "Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I suppose?"
     said he.

     "Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late; but the trains were
     awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession."

     "Exactly."

     "I have your letter here. You said, 'I desire to possess a copy of
     Devine's Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one
     which is in your possession.' Is that right?"

     "Certainly."

     "I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine
     how you knew that I owned such a thing."

     "Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very
     simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you
     their last copy, and he gave me your address."

     "Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?"

     "No, he did not."

     "Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only gave
     fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that
     before I take ten pounds from you."

     "I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have
     named that price, so I intend to stick to it."

     "Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust up
     with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!" He opened his bag, and
     at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust
     which we had already seen more than once in fragments.

     Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon
     the table.

     "You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence of
     these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every possible
     right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a methodical man, you
     see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. Thank
     you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good
     evening."

     When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes's movements were
     such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean white
     cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he placed his
     newly-acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. Finally, he picked up
     his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the
     head. The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over
     the shattered remains. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he
     held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a
     plum in a pudding.

     "Gentlemen," he cried, "let me introduce you to the famous black
     pearl of the Borgias."

     Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous
     impulse, we both broke out clapping as at the well-wrought crisis of
     a play. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes's pale cheeks, and he
     bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his
     audience. It was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be
     a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human love for admiration and
     applause. The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned
     away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved
     to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.

     "Yes, gentlemen," said he, "it is the most famous pearl now existing
     in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain
     of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna's
     bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of
     this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured
     by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You will remember, Lestrade, the
     sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel, and the
     vain efforts of the London police to recover it. I was myself
     consulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw any light upon it.
     Suspicion fell upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and
     it was proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to
     trace any connection between them. The maid's name was Lucretia
     Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was
     murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the
     dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the
     disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of
     Beppo for some crime of violence, an event which took place in the
     factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were
     being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you
     see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they
     presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He
     may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's
     confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his
     sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.

     "The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment, when it
     was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made for the
     factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few
     minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which
     would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six plaster
     casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them was still
     soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in
     the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered
     over the aperture once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one
     could possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year's
     imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over
     London. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by
     breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him nothing, for
     as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to
     it--as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted
     his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a
     cousin who works with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had
     bought the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson,
     and in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.
     Then, with the help of some Italian employe, he succeeded in finding
     out where the other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker's.
     There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible
     for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which
     followed."

     "If he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph?" I
     asked.

     "As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any
     third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after the murder I
     calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his
     movements. He would fear that the police would read his secret, and
     so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him. Of course, I
     could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker's bust. I had
     not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl; but it was
     evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the
     bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which
     had a lamp overlooking it. Since Harker's bust was one in three the
     chances were exactly as I told you, two to one against the pearl
     being inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he
     would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the house,
     so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down with the happiest
     results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the
     Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man linked
     the one event with the other. There only remained a single bust--the
     Reading one--and the pearl must be there. I bought it in your
     presence from the owner--and there it lies."

     We sat in silence for a moment.

     "Well," said Lestrade, "I've seen you handle a good many cases, Mr.
     Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than
     that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very
     proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there's not a man, from
     the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad
     to shake you by the hand."

     "Thank you!" said Holmes. "Thank you!" and as he turned away it
     seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human
     emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold and
     practical thinker once more. "Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,"
     said he, "and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case.
     Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes your way I shall be
     happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution."






                       THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS

     It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I
     need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some
     weeks in one of our great University towns, and it was during this
     time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to
     relate befell us. It will be obvious that any details which would
     help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would
     be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scandal may well be
     allowed to die out. With due discretion the incident itself may,
     however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those
     qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour in my
     statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to
     any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.

     "Yes, sir."

     "Not in the least."

     Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred
     urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and
     for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his
     approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in
     him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to
     city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking
     gleam of something like humour in his eyes.





          CHAPTER VII
          First Report of Dr. Watson


     We had all been warned to appear before the magistrates upon the
     Thursday; but when the Thursday came there was no occasion for our
     testimony. A higher Judge had taken the matter in hand, and Jefferson
     Hope had been summoned before a tribunal where strict justice would
     be meted out to him. On the very night after his capture the aneurism
     burst, and he was found in the morning stretched upon the floor of
     the cell, with a placid smile upon his face, as though he had been
     able in his dying moments to look back upon a useful life, and on
     work well done.


     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious
     face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten
     appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
     yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of
     his bearing which indicated the gentleman.

     "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.

     "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
     that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this
     morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you
     think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants
     more thinking out than I am able to give it."

     "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
     have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
     London?"

     "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
     It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me
     this morning."

     He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was
     of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir Henry
     Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters;
     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     evening.

     The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to
     the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.

     "Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?" the former
     asked.

     "Most certainly there is," I answered.

     "In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to
     take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty, sir, to
     give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down."

     "I'll sit down, with your leave," the prisoner said, suiting the
     action to the word. "This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and
     the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the
     brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I
     say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no
     consequence to me."

     With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began
     the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace
     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I
     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's
     words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.

     "It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's
     enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a
     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their
     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,
     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any
     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should
     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done
     the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my
     place.

     "That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.
     She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart
     over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed
     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his
     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I
     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his
     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to
     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is
     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and
     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left
     for me to hope for, or to desire.

     "They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving
     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a
     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain
     sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for
     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along
     somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that
     of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most
     confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted
     the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.

     "It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were
     living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across
     them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other
     side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them
     at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their
     recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my
     opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.

     "They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then

                        THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN

     I had intended "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange" to be the last of
     those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever
     communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any
     lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to
     which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest
     on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique
     methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance
     which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his
     experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the
     records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but
     since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to
     study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become
     hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in
     this matter should be strictly observed. It was only upon my
     representing to him that I had given a promise that "The Adventure of
     the Second Stain" should be published when the times were ripe, and
     pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series
     of episodes should culminate in the most important international case
     which he has ever been called upon to handle, that I at last
     succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully-guarded account
     of the incident should at last be laid before the public. If in
     telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the
     public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for
     my reticence.

     It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be
     nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two
     visitors of European fame within the walls of our humble room in
     Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant,
     was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of
     Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of
     middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was
     the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs,
     and the most rising statesman in the country. They sat side by side
     upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their
     worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing
     importance which had brought them. The Premier's thin, blue-veined
     hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and
     his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The
     European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted
     with the seals of his watch-chain.

     "When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o'clock
     this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his
     suggestion that we have both come to you."

     "Have you informed the police?"

     "No, sir," said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner
     for which he was famous. "We have not done so, nor is it possible
     that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run,
     mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to
     avoid."

     "And why, sir?"

     "Because the document in question is of such immense importance that
     its publication might very easily--I might almost say probably--lead
     to European complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to
     say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery
     can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be
     recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it
     is that its contents should be generally known."

     "I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if
     you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document
     disappeared."

     "That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it
     was a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. It
     was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I
     have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace,
     and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last
     night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was
     dressing for dinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it was
     gone. The despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my
     dressing-table all night. I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. We
     are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room
     during the night. And yet I repeat that the paper is gone."

     "What time did you dine?"

     "Half-past seven."

     "How long was it before you went to bed?"

     "My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was
     half-past eleven before we went to our room."

     "Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?"

     "No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in
     the morning, and my valet, or my wife's maid, during the rest of the
     day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some
     time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there
     was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in
     my despatch-box."

     "Who did know of the existence of that letter?"

     "No one in the house."

     "Surely your wife knew?"

     "No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this
     morning."

     The Premier nodded approvingly.

     "I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty," said
     he. "I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance
     it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties."

     The European Secretary bowed.

     "You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never
     breathed one word to my wife upon this matter."

     "Could she have guessed?"

     "No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed--nor could anyone have
     guessed."

     "Have you lost any documents before?"

     "No, sir."

     "Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this
     letter?"

     "Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the
     pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased
     by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good
     heavens, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost
     it!" His handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his
     hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the
     natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the
     aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned.
     "Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three,
     departmental officials who know of the letter. No one else in
     England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you."

     "But abroad?"

     "I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it.
     I am well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official
     channels have not been employed."

     Holmes considered for some little time.

     "Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is,
     and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?"

     The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier's shaggy
     eyebrows gathered in a frown.

     "Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour.
     There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is
     addressed in large, bold handwriting to--"

     "I fear, sir," said Holmes, "that, interesting and indeed essential
     as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of
     things. What was the letter?"

     "That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I
     cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of
     the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an
     envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved
     well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our
     power to bestow."

     Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.

     "You are two of the most busy men in the country," said he, "and in
     my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret
     exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any
     continuation of this interview would be a waste of time."

     The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his
     deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. "I am not
     accustomed, sir--" he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his
     seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old
     statesman shrugged his shoulders.

     "We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and
     it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our
     entire confidence."

     "I agree with you, sir," said the younger statesman.

     "Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of
     your colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for
     I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that
     this affair should come out."

     "You may safely trust us."

     "The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been
     ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It has
     been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.
     Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter.
     At the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and
     certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its
     publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of
     feeling in this country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I
     do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that
     letter this country would be involved in a great war."

     Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the
     Premier.

     "Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter--this letter which may
     well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a
     hundred thousand men--which has become lost in this unaccountable
     fashion."

     "Have you informed the sender?"

     "Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched."

     "Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter."

     "No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already
     understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner.
     It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if
     this letter were to come out."

     "If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out?
     Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?"

     "There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international
     politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no
     difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed
     camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military
     power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into
     war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other
     confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?"

     "Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this
     potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach
     between his country and ours?"

     "Yes, sir."

     "And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of
     an enemy?"

     "To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding
     on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take
     it."

     Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud.
     The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.

     "It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
     is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are
     in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?"

     Holmes shook his head mournfully.

     "You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be
     war?"

     "I think it is very probable."

     "Then, sir, prepare for war."

     "That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes."

     "Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after
     eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife
     were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It
     was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and
     eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it
     evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as
     early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were
     taken at that hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to
     retain it. It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What
     chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our
     reach."

     The Prime Minister rose from the settee.

     "What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the
     matter is indeed out of our hands."

     "Let us presume, for argument's sake, that the document was taken by
     the maid or by the valet--"

     "They are both old and tried servants."

     "I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that
     there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could
     go up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has
     taken it. To whom would the thief take it? To one of several
     international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably
     familiar to me. There are three who may be said to be the heads of
     their profession. I will begin my research by going round and finding
     if each of them is at his post. If one is missing--especially if he
     has disappeared since last night--we will have some indication as to
     where the document has gone."

     "Why should he be missing?" asked the European Secretary. "He would
     take the letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not."

     "I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations
     with the Embassies are often strained."

     The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.

     "I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a
     prize to head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course
     of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all
     our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be
     any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you,
     and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries."

     The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.

     When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in
     silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had
     opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime
     which had occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an
     exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the
     mantelpiece.

     "Yes," said he, "there is no better way of approaching it. The
     situation is desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be
     sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not
     yet passed out of his hands. After all, it is a question of money
     with these fellows, and I have the British Treasury behind me. If
     it's on the market I'll buy it--if it means another penny on the
     income-tax. It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to
     see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the
     other. There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game;
     there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. I will see each
     of them."

     I glanced at my morning paper.

     "Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?"

     "Yes."

     "You will not see him."

     "Why not?"

     "He was murdered in his house last night."

     My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures
     that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely
     I had astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the
     paper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged
     in reading when he rose from his chair:

                              Murder in Westminster
     A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16,
     Godolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of
     eighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey,
     almost in the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament.
     This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by
     Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of
     his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved
     reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country.
     Mr. Lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his
     establishment consists of Mrs. Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and
     of Mitton, his valet. The former retires early and sleeps at the top
     of the house. The valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at
     Hammersmith. From ten o'clock onwards Mr. Lucas had the house to
     himself. What occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but
     at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett, passing along
     Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No. 16 was ajar. He
     knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the front room
     he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without reply. He
     then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in a state of
     wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one
     chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still
     grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He
     had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife
     with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger,
     plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the
     walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime,
     for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the
     room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his
     violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense
     sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.

     "Well, Watson, what do you make of this?" asked Holmes, after a long
     pause.

     "It is an amazing coincidence."

     "A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as
     possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during
     the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The
     odds are enormous against its being coincidence. No figures could
     express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected--must
     be connected. It is for us to find the connection."

     "But now the official police must know all."

     "Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They
     know--and shall know--nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only we know of
     both events, and can trace the relation between them. There is one
     obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions
     against Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes'
     walk from Whitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have
     named live in the extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore, for
     Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a
     message from the European Secretary's household--a small thing, and
     yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove
     essential. Halloa! what have we here?"

     Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes
     glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.

     "Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step
     up," said he.

     A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that
     morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely
     woman in London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest
     daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no
     contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the
     subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite
     head. And yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty
     which would be the first thing to impress the observer. The cheek was
     lovely, but it was paled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it
     was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn
     in an effort after self-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang
     first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in
     the open door.

     "Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Yes, madam, he has been here."

     "Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here." Holmes
     bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.

     "Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you
     will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot
     make any unconditional promise."

     She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the
     window. It was a queenly presence--tall, graceful, and intensely
     womanly.

     "Mr. Holmes," she said, and her white-gloved hands clasped and
     unclasped as she spoke--"I will speak frankly to you in the hope that
     it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete
     confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That
     one is politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing.
     Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our
     house last night. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because
     the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his
     complete confidence. Now it is essential--essential, I say--that I
     should thoroughly understand it. You are the only other person, save
     only these politicians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then,
     Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will
     lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client's
     interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he
     would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his
     complete confidence. What was this paper which was stolen?"

     "Madam, what you ask me is really impossible."

     She groaned and sank her face in her hands.

     "You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to
     keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only
     learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to
     tell what he has withheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom
     you must ask."

     "I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your
     telling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service
     if you would enlighten me on one point."

     "What is it, madam?"

     "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this
     incident?"

     "Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very
     unfortunate effect."

     "Ah!" She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are
     resolved.

     "One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband
     dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that
     terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this
     document."


Iteration: 20000
     "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"

     "I do not know what to believe."

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

     "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     admit that the footmark is material."

     "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out,
     and yet he was diabolical as well."

     "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But
     now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have
     you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it
     is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me
     to do it."

     "I did not say that I desired you to do it."

     "Then, how can I assist you?"

     "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville,
     who arrives at Waterloo Station"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his
     watch--"in exactly one hour and a quarter."

     "He being the heir?"

     "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
     gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the
     accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
     way. I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of
     Sir Charles's will."

     "There is no other claimant, I presume?"

     "None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was
     Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir
     Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the
     father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of
     the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was
     the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He
     made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died
     there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
     In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have
     had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr.
     Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"

     "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"

     "It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
     Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that
     if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would
     have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and
     the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be
     denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side
     depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by
     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
     Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious
     interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you
     and ask for your advice."

     Holmes considered for a little time.

     "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your opinion
     there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for
     a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"

     "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
     that this may be so."

     "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
     could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A
     devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too
     inconceivable a thing."

     "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would
     probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
     things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man
     will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty
     minutes. What would you recommend?"

     "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
     scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir
     Henry Baskerville."

     "And then?"

     "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my
     mind about the matter."

     "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"

     "Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
     much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of
     help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry
     Baskerville with you."

     "I will do so, Mr. Holmes." He scribbled the appointment on his
     shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
     fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

     "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir
     Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon
     the moor?"

     "Three people did."

     "Did any see it after?"

     "I have not heard of any."

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
     satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

     "Going out, Watson?"

     "Unless I can help you."

     "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you
     for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of
     view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound
     of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you
     could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should
     be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting
     problem which has been submitted to us this morning."

     I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
     in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he
     weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories,
     balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which
     points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day
     at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was
     nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once
     more.

     My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken
     out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp
     upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears
     were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco
     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I
     had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an
     armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of
     paper lay around him.

     "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.

     "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."

     "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."

     "Thick! It is intolerable."

     "Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
     perceive."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "Am I right?"

     "Certainly, but how?"

     He laughed at my bewildered expression.

     "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a
     pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your
     expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
     immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
     boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with
     intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
     obvious?"

     "Well, it is rather obvious."

     "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
     observes. Where do you think that I have been?"

     "A fixture also."

     "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."

     "In spirit?"

     "Exactly. My body has remained in this arm-chair and has, I regret to
     observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
     incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
     Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my
     spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could
     find my way about."

     "A large scale map, I presume?"

     "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
     "Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is
     Baskerville Hall in the middle."

     "With a wood round it?"

     "Exactly. I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name,
     must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon
     the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of
     Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a
     radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered
     dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative.
     There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
     naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are
     two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles
     away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these
     scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is
     the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may
     help to play it again."

     "It must be a wild place."

     "Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
     hand in the affairs of men--"

     "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."

     "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There
     are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether
     any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime
     and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should
     be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws
     of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to
     exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I
     think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. It is a
     singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a
     concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of
     getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my
     convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"

     "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."

     "What do you make of it?"

     "It is very bewildering."

     "It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
     distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
     What do you make of that?"

     "Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
     the alley."

     "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should
     a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"

     "What then?"

     "He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,
     running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face."

     "Running from what?"

     "There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was
     crazed with fear before ever he began to run."

     "How can you say that?"

     "I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the
     moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had
     lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If
     the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help
     in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom
     was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the
     Yew Alley rather than in his own house?"

     "You think that he was waiting for someone?"

     "The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an
     evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is
     it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr.
     Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him
     credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"

     "But he went out every evening."

     "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening.
     On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night
     he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for
     London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I
     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."





          CHAPTER IV
          Sir Henry Baskerville


     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious
     face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten
     appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
     yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of
     his bearing which indicated the gentleman.

     "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.

     "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
     that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this
     morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you
     think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants
     more thinking out than I am able to give it."

     "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
     have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
     London?"

     "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
     It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me
     this morning."

     He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was
     of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir Henry
     Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters;
     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     evening.

     "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked
     Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

     "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     "No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor. "There was
     no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel."

     "Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements."
     Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded
     into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the
     middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of
     pasting printed words upon it. It ran:

     As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

     The word "moor" only was printed in ink.

     "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
     Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that
     takes so much interest in my affairs?"

     "What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
     nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"

     "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
     that the business is supernatural."

     "What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply. "It seems to me that all
     you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."

     "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
     I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will confine ourselves
     for the present with your permission to this very interesting
     document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday
     evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"

     "It is here in the corner."

     "Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the
     leading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up
     and down the columns. "Capital article this on free trade. Permit me
     to give you an extract from it.

     "'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or
     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it
     stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
     wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower
     the general conditions of life in this island.'

     "What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee,
     rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think that
     is an admirable sentiment?"

     Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest,
     and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

     "I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind," said
     he; "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that
     note is concerned."

     "On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
     Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I
     fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this
     sentence."

     "No, I confess that I see no connection."

     "And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that
     the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,'
     'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence
     these words have been taken?"

     "By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!" cried Sir
     Henry.

     "If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep
     away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece."

     "Well, now--so it is!"

     "Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have
     imagined," said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. "I
     could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper;
     but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading
     article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have
     ever known. How did you do it?"

     "I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from
     that of an Esquimau?"

     "Most certainly."

     "But how?"

     "Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The
     supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--"

     "But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally
     obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded
     bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an
     evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and
     your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the most elementary
     branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I
     confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury
     with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely
     distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else.
     As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should
     find the words in yesterday's issue."

     "So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes," said Sir Henry
     Baskerville, "someone cut out this message with a scissors--"

     "Nail-scissors," said Holmes. "You can see that it was a very
     short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over
     'keep away.'"

     "That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
     short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--"

     "Gum," said Holmes.

     "With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'
     should have been written?"

     "Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all
     simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less
     common."

     "Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else
     in this message, Mr. Holmes?"

     "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
     taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in
     rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in
     any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it,
     therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished
     to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own
     writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be
     known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed
     on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others.
     'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point
     to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part
     of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the
     matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer
     of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up
     the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any
     letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
     would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption--and
     from whom?"

     "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr.
     Mortimer.

     "Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and
     choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination,
     but we have always some material basis on which to start our
     speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am
     almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."

     "How in the world can you say that?"

     "If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the
     ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a
     single word, and has run dry three times in a short address, showing
     that there was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or
     ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the

Iteration: 21000
     "She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up,
     you have no life left in you."

     "Don't mind me," said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips,
     and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning.
     "Married, you say?"

     "Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment
     House. There was some words between young Drebber and young
     Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party
     that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed
     to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council,
     Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to
     him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her
     face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off,
     then?"

     "Yes, I am off," said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat.
     His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was
     its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.

     "Where are you going?"

     "Never mind," he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his
     shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the
     mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there
     was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.

     The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it
     was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful
     marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her
     head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish
     husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John
     Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his
     bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with
     her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were
     grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to
     their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open,
     and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode
     into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he
     walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the
     pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips
     reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he
     took the wedding-ring from her finger. "She shall not be buried in
     that," he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be
     raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief
     was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to
     believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been
     for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as
     having been a bride had disappeared.

     For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading
     a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for
     vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the
     weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which
     haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through
     Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot
     of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great
     boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by
     throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long
     in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led
     repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or
     killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted
     the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of
     having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax
     these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their
     opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.

     Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's
     mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of
     revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no
     room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things
     practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not
     stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and
     want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog
     among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet
     such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that
     that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the
     old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money
     enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.

     His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a
     combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the
     mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory
     of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on
     that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave.
     Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City,
     careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he
     knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There
     had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some
     of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the
     authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a
     certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become
     Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one
     knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed
     to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had
     departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was
     comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their
     whereabouts.

     Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of
     revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never
     faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked
     out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to
     town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed
     into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on,
     a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon
     which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded.
     It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told
     him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit
     of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance
     all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his
     window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder
     in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by
     Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to
     him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and
     hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into
     custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some
     weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that
     Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had
     departed for Europe.

     Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred
     urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and
     for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his
     approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in
     him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to
     city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking
     the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for
     Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just
     set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days
     late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded
     in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do
     better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in
     Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.





          CHAPTER VI
          A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.


     Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any
     ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself
     powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes
     that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. "I guess you're going
     to take me to the police-station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.
     "My cab's at the door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it.
     I'm not so light to lift as I used to be."

     Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this
     proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner
     at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his
     ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself
     that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself,
     as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man;
     and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and
     energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.

     "If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you
     are the man for it," he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at
     my fellow-lodger. "The way you kept on my trail was a caution."

     "You had better come with me," said Holmes to the two detectives.

     "I can drive you," said Lestrade.

     "Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have
     taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us."

     I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made
     no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been
     his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the
     horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We
     were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down
     our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had
     been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who
     went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. "The prisoner will
     be put before the magistrates in the course of the week," he said;
     "in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you
     wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and
     may be used against you."

     "I've got a good deal to say," our prisoner said slowly. "I want to
     tell you gentlemen all about it."

     "Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?" asked the Inspector.

     "I may never be tried," he answered. "You needn't look startled. It
     isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?" He turned his
     fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.

     "Yes; I am," I answered.

     "Then put your hand here," he said, with a smile, motioning with his
     manacled wrists towards his chest.

     I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing
     and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest
     seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when
     some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could
     hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same
     source.

     "Why," I cried, "you have an aortic aneurism!"

     "That's what they call it," he said, placidly. "I went to a Doctor
     last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before
     many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from
     over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've
     done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like
     to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be
     remembered as a common cut-throat."

     The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to
     the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.

     "Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?" the former
     asked.

     "Most certainly there is," I answered.

     "In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to
     take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty, sir, to
     give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down."

     "I'll sit down, with your leave," the prisoner said, suiting the
     action to the word. "This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and
     the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the
     brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I
     say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no
     consequence to me."

     With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began
     the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace
     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I
     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's
     words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.

     "It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's
     enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a
     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their
     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,
     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any
     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should
     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done
     the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my
     place.

     "That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.
     She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart
     over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed
     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his
     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I
     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his
     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to
     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is
     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and
     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left
     for me to hope for, or to desire.

     "They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving
     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a
     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain
     sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for
     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along
     somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that
     of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most
     confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted
     the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.

     "It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were
     living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across
     them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other
     side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them
     at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their
     recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my
     opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.

     "They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then
     they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or
     late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get
     behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long
     as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.

     "They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there
     was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out
     alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind
     them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was
     drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I
     watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but
     I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost
     come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a
     little too soon and leave my work undone.

     "At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as
     the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive
     up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a
     time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up
     my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for
     I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston
     Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed
     them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train,
     and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be
     another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but
     Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in
     the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them.
     Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that
     if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His
     companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had
     resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a
     delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what
     Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and
     reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that
     he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it
     up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the
     last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which
     Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven,
     and made his way out of the station.

     "The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my
     enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but
     singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue
     precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction
     in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that
     strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans
     arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who
     had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It
     chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in
     looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of
     one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and
     returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a
     duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one
     spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from
     interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult
     problem which I had now to solve.

     "He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops,
     staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out
     he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was
     a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so
     close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the
     whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of
     streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the
     Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his
     intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab
     a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom
     drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets
     dry with the talking."

     I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.

     "That's better," he said. "Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour,
     or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling
     inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men
     appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap
     whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar,
     and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a
     kick which sent him half across the road. 'You hound,' he cried,
     shaking his stick at him; 'I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!'
     He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his
     cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his
     legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing
     my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private
     Hotel,' said he.

     "When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy
     that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I
     drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I
     might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted
     lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this,
     when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him
     again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in,
     leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until
     closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the
     game was in my own hands.

     "Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would
     only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring
     myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for
     his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets
     which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once
     janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day
     the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students
     some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some
     South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least
     grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this
     preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to
     a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this
     alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with
     a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that
     when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one
     of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite
     as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a
     handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me,
     and the time had now come when I was to use them.

     "It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard
     and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad
     within--so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation.
     If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for
     it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your
     reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at
     it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples
     throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier
     and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me,
     just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were
     ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the
     house in the Brixton Road.

     "There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the
     dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber
     all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm,
     'It's time to get out,' I said.

     "'All right, cabby,' said he.

     "I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,
     for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.
     I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a
     little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him
     into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father
     and the daughter were walking in front of us.

     "'It's infernally dark,' said he, stamping about.

     "'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it
     to a wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I
     continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who
     am I?'

     "He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I
     saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features,
     which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face,
     and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth
     chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the
     door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance
     would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul
     which now possessed me.

     "'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.
     Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your
     wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see
     to-morrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I
     could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the
     time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I
     believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not
     gushed from my nose and relieved me.

     "'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door,
     and shaking the key in his face. 'Punishment has been slow in coming,
     but it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward lips tremble as I
     spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it
     was useless.

     "'Would you murder me?' he stammered.

     "'There is no murder,' I answered. 'Who talks of murdering a mad dog?
     What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from
     her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and
     shameless harem.'

     "'It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.

     "'But it was you who broke her innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting
     the box before him. 'Let the high God judge between us. Choose and
     eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what
     you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we
     are ruled by chance.'

     "He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my
     knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I
     swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a
     minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to
     die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the
     first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I
     laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his
     eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is
     rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out
     in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily
     upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand
     upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!

     "The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice
     of it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write
     upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of
     setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and
     cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE
     written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers
     that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what
     puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my
     finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the
     wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody

Iteration: 22000
     "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "It was a dangerous, reckless
     attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having
     found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to
     be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
     could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was
     much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the
     missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of
     the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it
     into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put
     it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an
     effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that
     they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise
     they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was
     about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by
     the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and
     so changed the conversation."

     "Good heavens!" cried the Colonel, laughing, "do you mean to say all
     our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?"

     "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," cried I, looking in
     amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new
     phase of his astuteness.

     "It is an art which is often useful," said he. "When I recovered I
     managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of
     ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that
     I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper."

     "Oh, what an ass I have been!" I exclaimed.

     "I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,"
     said Holmes, laughing. "I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
     which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and
     having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind
     the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their
     attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I
     had hardly got the paper, however--which was, as I had expected, in
     one of them--when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
     believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and
     friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat
     now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get
     the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you
     see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair
     made them perfectly desperate.

     "I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive
     of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
     demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could
     positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was

     Holmes considered for a little time.

     "The door must come down," he answered, and, springing against it, he
     put all his weight upon the lock. It creaked and groaned, but did not
     yield. Together we flung ourselves upon it once more, and this time
     it gave way with a sudden snap, and we found ourselves within
     Bartholomew Sholto's chamber.

     It appeared to have been fitted up as a chemical laboratory. A double
     line of glass-stoppered bottles was drawn up upon the wall opposite
     the door, and the table was littered over with Bunsen burners,
     test-tubes, and retorts. In the corners stood carboys of acid in
     wicker baskets. One of these appeared to leak or to have been broken,
     for a stream of dark-colored liquid had trickled out from it, and the
     air was heavy with a peculiarly pungent, tar-like odor. A set of
     steps stood at one side of the room, in the midst of a litter of lath
     and plaster, and above them there was an opening in the ceiling large
     enough for a man to pass through. At the foot of the steps a long
     coil of rope was thrown carelessly together.

     By the table, in a wooden arm-chair, the master of the house was
     seated all in a heap, with his head sunk upon his left shoulder, and
     that ghastly, inscrutable smile upon his face. He was stiff and cold,
     and had clearly been dead many hours. It seemed to me that not only
     his features but all his limbs were twisted and turned in the most
     fantastic fashion. By his hand upon the table there lay a peculiar
     instrument,--a brown, close-grained stick, with a stone head like a
     hammer, rudely lashed on with coarse twine. Beside it was a torn
     sheet of note-paper with some words scrawled upon it. Holmes glanced
     at it, and then handed it to me.

     "You see," he said, with a significant raising of the eyebrows.

     In the light of the lantern I read, with a thrill of horror, "The
     sign of the four."

     "In God's name, what does it all mean?" I asked.

     "It means murder," said he, stooping over the dead man. "Ah, I
     expected it. Look here!" He pointed to what looked like a long, dark
     thorn stuck in the skin just above the ear.

     "It looks like a thorn," said I.

     "It is a thorn. You may pick it out. But be careful, for it is
     poisoned."

     I took it up between my finger and thumb. It came away from the skin
     so readily that hardly any mark was left behind. One tiny speck of
     blood showed where the puncture had been.

     "This is all an insoluble mystery to me," said I. "It grows darker
     instead of clearer."

     "On the contrary," he answered, "it clears every instant. I only
     require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case."

     "'Tell me, Helen,' said she, 'have you ever heard anyone whistle in
     require a few missing links to have an entirely connected case."

     We had almost forgotten our companion's presence since we entered the
     chamber. He was still standing in the door-way, the very picture of
     terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,
     he broke out into a sharp, querulous cry.

     "The treasure is gone!" he said. "They have robbed him of the
     treasure! There is the hole through which we lowered it. I helped him
     to do it! I was the last person who saw him! I left him here last
     night, and I heard him lock the door as I came down-stairs."

     "What time was that?"

     "It was ten o'clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be
     called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh,
     yes, I am sure I shall. But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you
     don't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you
     here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!"
     He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive
     frenzy.

     "You have no reason for fear, Mr. Sholto," said Holmes, kindly,
     putting his hand upon his shoulder. "Take my advice, and drive down
     to the station to report this matter to the police. Offer to assist
     them in every way. We shall wait here until your return."

     The little man obeyed in a half-stupefied fashion, and we heard him
     stumbling down the stairs in the dark.





          CHAPTER VI
          Sherlock Holmes Gives a Demonstration


     "Now, Watson," said Holmes, rubbing his hands, "we have half an hour
     to ourselves. Let us make good use of it. My case is, as I have told
     you, almost complete; but we must not err on the side of
     over-confidence. Simple as the case seems now, there may be something
     deeper underlying it."

     "Simple!" I ejaculated.

     "Surely," said he, with something of the air of a clinical professor
     expounding to his class. "Just sit in the corner there, that your
     footprints may not complicate matters. Now to work! In the first
     place, how did these folk come, and how did they go? The door has not
     been opened since last night. How of the window?" He carried the lamp
     across to it, muttering his observations aloud the while, but
     addressing them to himself rather than to me. "Window is snibbed on
     the inner side. Framework is solid. No hinges at the side. Let us
     open it. No water-pipe near. Roof quite out of reach. Yet a man has
     mounted by the window. It rained a little last night. Here is the
     print of a foot in mould upon the sill. And here is a circular muddy
     mark, and here again upon the floor, and here again by the table. See
     here, Watson! This is really a very pretty demonstration."

     I looked at the round, well-defined muddy discs. "This is not a
     footmark," said I.

     "It is something much more valuable to us. It is the impression of a
     wooden stump. You see here on the sill is the boot-mark, a heavy boot
     with the broad metal heel, and beside it is the mark of the
     timber-toe."

     "It is the wooden-legged man."

     "Quite so. But there has been some one else,--a very able and
     efficient ally. Could you scale that wall, doctor?"

     I looked out of the open window. The moon still shone brightly on
     that angle of the house. We were a good sixty feet from the ground,
     and, look where I would, I could see no foothold, nor as much as a
     crevice in the brick-work.

     "It is absolutely impossible," I answered.

     "Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who
     lowered you this good stout rope which I see in the corner, securing
     one end of it to this great hook in the wall. Then, I think, if you
     were an active man, you might swarm up, wooden leg and all. You would
     depart, of course, in the same fashion, and your ally would draw up
     the rope, untie it from the hook, shut the window, snib it on the
     inside, and get away in the way that he originally came. As a minor
     point it may be noted," he continued, fingering the rope, "that our
     wooden-legged friend, though a fair climber, was not a professional
     sailor. His hands were far from horny. My lens discloses more than
     one blood-mark, especially towards the end of the rope, from which I
     gather that he slipped down with such velocity that he took the skin
     off his hand."

     "This is all very well," said I, "but the thing becomes more
     unintelligible than ever. How about this mysterious ally? How came he
     into the room?"

     "Yes, the ally!" repeated Holmes, pensively. "There are features of
     interest about this ally. He lifts the case from the regions of the
     commonplace. I fancy that this ally breaks fresh ground in the annals
     of crime in this country,--though parallel cases suggest themselves
     from India, and, if my memory serves me, from Senegambia."

     "How came he, then?" I reiterated. "The door is locked, the window is
     inaccessible. Was it through the chimney?"

     "The grate is much too small," he answered. "I had already considered
     that possibility."

     "How then?" I persisted.

     "You will not apply my precept," he said, shaking his head. "How
     often have I said to you that when you have eliminated the impossible
     whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth? We know that
     he did not come through the door, the window, or the chimney. We also
     know that he could not have been concealed in the room, as there is
     no concealment possible. Whence, then, did he come?"

     "He came through the hole in the roof," I cried.

     "Of course he did. He must have done so. If you will have the
     kindness to hold the lamp for me, we shall now extend our researches
     to the room above,--the secret room in which the treasure was found."

     He mounted the steps, and, seizing a rafter with either hand, he
     swung himself up into the garret. Then, lying on his face, he reached
     down for the lamp and held it while I followed him.

     The chamber in which we found ourselves was about ten feet one way
     and six the other. The floor was formed by the rafters, with thin
     lath-and-plaster between, so that in walking one had to step from
     beam to beam. The roof ran up to an apex, and was evidently the inner
     shell of the true roof of the house. There was no furniture of any
     sort, and the accumulated dust of years lay thick upon the floor.

     "Here you are, you see," said Sherlock Holmes, putting his hand
     against the sloping wall. "This is a trap-door which leads out on to
     the roof. I can press it back, and here is the roof itself, sloping
     at a gentle angle. This, then, is the way by which Number One
     entered. Let us see if we can find one other traces of his
     individuality."

     He held down the lamp to the floor, and as he did so I saw for the
     second time that night a startled, surprised look come over his face.
     For myself, as I followed his gaze my skin was cold under my clothes.
     The floor was covered thickly with the prints of a naked
     foot,--clear, well defined, perfectly formed, but scarce half the
     size of those of an ordinary man.

     "Holmes," I said, in a whisper, "a child has done the horrid thing."

     He had recovered his self-possession in an instant. "I was staggered
     for the moment," he said, "but the thing is quite natural. My memory
     failed me, or I should have been able to foretell it. There is
     nothing more to be learned here. Let us go down."

     "What is your theory, then, as to those footmarks?" I asked, eagerly,
     when we had regained the lower room once more.

     "My dear Watson, try a little analysis yourself," said he, with a
     touch of impatience. "You know my methods. Apply them, and it will be
     instructive to compare results."

     "I cannot conceive anything which will cover the facts," I answered.

     "It will be clear enough to you soon," he said, in an off-hand way.
     "I think that there is nothing else of importance here, but I will
     look." He whipped out his lens and a tape measure, and hurried about
     the room on his knees, measuring, comparing, examining, with his long
     thin nose only a few inches from the planks, and his beady eyes
     gleaming and deep-set like those of a bird. So swift, silent, and
     furtive were his movements, like those of a trained blood-hound
     picking out a scent, that I could not but think what a terrible
     criminal he would have made had he turned his energy and sagacity
     against the law, instead of exerting them in its defense. As he
     hunted about, he kept muttering to himself, and finally he broke out
     into a loud crow of delight.

     "We are certainly in luck," said he. "We ought to have very little
     trouble now. Number One has had the misfortune to tread in the
     creosote. You can see the outline of the edge of his small foot here
     at the side of this evil-smelling mess. The carboy has been cracked,
     You see, and the stuff has leaked out."

     "What then?" I asked.

     "Why, we have got him, that's all," said he. "I know a dog that would
     follow that scent to the world's end. If a pack can track a trailed
     herring across a shire, how far can a specially-trained hound follow
     so pungent a smell as this? It sounds like a sum in the rule of
     three. The answer should give us the--But halloo! here are the
     accredited representatives of the law."

     Heavy steps and the clamor of loud voices were audible from below,
     and the hall door shut with a loud crash.

     "Before they come," said Holmes, "just put your hand here on this
     poor fellow's arm, and here on his leg. What do you feel?"

     "The muscles are as hard as a board," I answered.

     "Quite so. They are in a state of extreme contraction, far exceeding
     the usual rigor mortis. Coupled with this distortion of the face,
     this Hippocratic smile, or 'risus sardonicus,' as the old writers
     called it, what conclusion would it suggest to your mind?"

     "Death from some powerful vegetable alkaloid," I answered,--"some
     strychnine-like substance which would produce tetanus."

     "That was the idea which occurred to me the instant I saw the drawn
     muscles of the face. On getting into the room I at once looked for
     the means by which the poison had entered the system. As you saw, I
     discovered a thorn which had been driven or shot with no great force
     into the scalp. You observe that the part struck was that which would
     be turned towards the hole in the ceiling if the man were erect in
     his chair. Now examine the thorn."

     I took it up gingerly and held it in the light of the lantern. It was
     long, sharp, and black, with a glazed look near the point as though
     some gummy substance had dried upon it. The blunt end had been
     trimmed and rounded off with a knife.

     "Is that an English thorn?" he asked.

     "No, it certainly is not."

     "With all these data you should be able to draw some just inference.
     But here are the regulars: so the auxiliary forces may beat a
     retreat."

     As he spoke, the steps which had been coming nearer sounded loudly on
     the passage, and a very stout, portly man in a gray suit strode
     heavily into the room. He was red-faced, burly and plethoric, with a
     pair of very small twinkling eyes which looked keenly out from
     between swollen and puffy pouches. He was closely followed by an
     inspector in uniform, and by the still palpitating Thaddeus Sholto.

     "Here's a business!" he cried, in a muffled, husky voice. "Here's a
     pretty business! But who are all these? Why, the house seems to be as
     full as a rabbit-warren!"

     "I think you must recollect me, Mr. Athelney Jones," said Holmes,
     quietly.

     "Why, of course I do!" he wheezed. "It's Mr. Sherlock Holmes, the
     theorist. Remember you! I'll never forget how you lectured us all on
     causes and inferences and effects in the Bishopgate jewel case. It's
     true you set us on the right track; but you'll own now that it was
     quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants.  On that
     first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her
     peering down at the gleam of the breaking water far below us against
     to Philadelphia. Mr. Rucastle told me in private that the reason why
     she had left them was that she had an unreasoning aversion to her
     express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected--must
     wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one
     chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still
     grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He
     had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife
     with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger,
     plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the
     walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime,
     for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the
     room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his
     violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense
     sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.





                       THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS

     "Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover," he answered,
     with a shrewd, sidelong look. "The man that was clever enough to hunt
     me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a
     river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a
     harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when
     you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I've
     had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry
     over spilled milk."

     "This is a very serious matter, Small," said the detective. "If you
     had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would
     have had a better chance at your trial."

     "Justice!" snarled the ex-convict. "A pretty justice! Whose loot is
     this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it
     up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it!
     Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under
     the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts,
     bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed
     black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That
     was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice
     because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that
     another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have
     one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and
     feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that
     should be mine." Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this
     came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the
     handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his
     hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the
     man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had
     possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict
     was upon his track.

     "You forget that we know nothing of all this," said Holmes quietly.
     "We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may
     originally have been on your side."

     "Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see
     that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists.
     Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If
     you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say
     to you is God's truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the
     glass beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry.

     "I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore. I dare say
     you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look.
     I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is
     that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they
     would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going
     folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side,
     while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was
     about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess
     over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's
     shilling and joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India.

     "I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got
     past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool
     enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company
     sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was
     one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just
     as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a
     surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock
     and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder
     had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months
     in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it
     with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided
     out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation.

     "I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for
     I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However,
     my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named
     Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an
     overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He
     happened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest
     in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel
     recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to
     be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough
     knee left to keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to
     ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked,
     and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable
     quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my
     life in indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would
     often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white
     folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do
     here at home.

     "Well, I was never in luck's way long. Suddenly, without a note of
     warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still
     and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there
     were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was
     a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal
     more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only
     know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place
     called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night
     after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and
     day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our
     estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where
     were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He had
     it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it
     would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his
     veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the
     country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and
     Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the
     managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a
     distant plantation, and was riding slowly home in the evening, when
     my eye fell upon something all huddled together at the bottom of a
     steep nullah. I rode down to see what it was, and the cold struck
     through my heart when I found it was Dawson's wife, all cut into
     ribbons, and half eaten by jackals and native dogs. A little further
     up the road Dawson himself was lying on his face, quite dead, with an
     empty revolver in his hand and four Sepoys lying across each other in
     front of him. I reined up my horse, wondering which way I should
     turn, but at that moment I saw thick smoke curling up from
     Abelwhite's bungalow and the flames beginning to burst through the
     roof. I knew then that I could do my employer no good, but would only

Iteration: 23000
     "'Let me hear her say so. Kratides.'

     "'You shall see her if you sign. Where are you from?'

     "'Then I shall never see her. Athens.'

     "Another five minutes, Mr. Holmes, and I should have wormed out the
     whole story under their very noses.  My very next question might have
     cleared the matter up, but at that instant the door opened and a
     woman stepped into the room.  I could not see her clearly enough to
     know more than that she was tall and graceful, with black hair, and
     clad in some sort of loose white gown.

     "'Harold,' said she, speaking English with a broken accent.  'I could
     not stay away longer.  It is so lonely up there with only--Oh, my
     God, it is Paul!'

     "These last words were in Greek, and at the same instant the man with
     a convulsive effort tore the plaster from his lips, and screaming out
     'Sophy!  Sophy!' rushed into the woman's arms.  Their embrace was but
     for an instant, however, for the younger man seized the woman and
     pushed her out of the room, while the elder easily overpowered his
     emaciated victim, and dragged him away through the other door.  For a
     moment I was left alone in the room, and I sprang to my feet with
     some vague idea that I might in some way get a clue to what this
     house was in which I found myself.  Fortunately, however, I took no
     steps, for looking up I saw that the older man was standing in the
     door-way with his eyes fixed upon me.

     "'That will do, Mr. Melas,' said he.  'You perceive that we have
     taken you into our confidence over some very private business.  We
     should not have troubled you, only that our friend who speaks Greek
     and who began these negotiations has been forced to return to the
     East.  It was quite necessary for us to find some one to take his
     place, and we were fortunate in hearing of your powers.'

     "I bowed.

     "'There are five sovereigns here,' said he, walking up to me, 'which
     will, I hope, be a sufficient fee.  But remember,' he added, tapping
     me lightly on the chest and giggling, 'if you speak to a human soul
     about this--one human soul, mind--well, may God have mercy upon your
     soul!'

     "I cannot tell you the loathing and horror with which this
     insignificant-looking man inspired me.  I could see him better now as
     the lamp-light shone upon him.  His features were peaky and sallow,
     and his little pointed beard was thready and ill-nourished.  He
     pushed his face forward as he spoke and his lips and eyelids were
     continually twitching like a man with St. Vitus's dance.  I could not
     help thinking that his strange, catchy little laugh was also a
     symptom of some nervous malady.  The terror of his face lay in his
     eyes, however, steel gray, and glistening coldly with a malignant,
     inexorable cruelty in their depths.

     "'We shall know if you speak of this,' said he.  'We have our own
     means of information.  Now you will find the carriage waiting, and my
     friend will see you on your way.'

     "I was hurried through the hall and into the vehicle, again obtaining
     that momentary glimpse of trees and a garden.  Mr. Latimer followed
     closely at my heels, and took his place opposite to me without a
     word.  In silence we again drove for an interminable distance with
     the windows raised, until at last, just after midnight, the carriage
     pulled up.

     "'You will get down here, Mr. Melas,' said my companion.  'I am sorry
     to leave you so far from your house, but there is no alternative. 
     Any attempt upon your part to follow the carriage can only end in
     injury to yourself.'

     "He opened the door as he spoke, and I had hardly time to spring out
     when the coachman lashed the horse and the carriage rattled away.  I
     looked around me in astonishment.  I was on some sort of a heathy
     common mottled over with dark clumps of furze-bushes.  Far away
     stretched a line of houses, with a light here and there in the upper
     windows.  On the other side I saw the red signal-lamps of a railway.

     "The carriage which had brought me was already out of sight.  I stood
     gazing round and wondering where on earth I might be, when I saw some
     one coming towards me in the darkness.  As he came up to me I made
     out that he was a railway porter.

     "'Can you tell me what place this is?' I asked.

     "'Wandsworth Common,' said he.

     "'Can I get a train into town?'

     "'Wandsworth Common,' said he.

     "'Can I get a train into town?'

     "'If you walk on a mile or so to Clapham Junction,' said he, 'you'll
     just be in time for the last to Victoria.'

     "So that was the end of my adventure, Mr. Holmes.  I do not know
     where I was, nor whom I spoke with, nor anything save what I have
     told you.  But I know that there is foul play going on, and I want to
     help that unhappy man if I can.  I told the whole story to Mr.
     Mycroft Holmes next morning, and subsequently to the police."

     We all sat in silence for some little time after listening to this
     extraordinary narrative.  Then Sherlock looked across at his brother.

     "Any steps?" he asked.

     Mycroft picked up the Daily News, which was lying on the side-table.

     "Anybody supplying any information as to the whereabouts of a Greek
     gentleman named Paul Kratides, from Athens, who is unable to speak
     English, will be rewarded.  A similar reward paid to any one giving
     information about a Greek lady whose first name is Sophy. X 2473.

     "That was in all the dailies.  No answer."

     "How about the Greek Legation?"

     "I have inquired.  They know nothing."

     "A wire to the head of the Athens police, then?"

     "Sherlock has all the energy of the family," said Mycroft, turning to
     me.  "Well, you take the case up by all means, and let me know if you
     do any good."

     "Certainly," answered my friend, rising from his chair.  "I'll let
     you know, and Mr. Melas also.  In the meantime, Mr. Melas, I should
     certainly be on my guard, if I were you, for of course they must know
     through these advertisements that you have betrayed them."

     As we walked home together, Holmes stopped at a telegraph office and
     sent off several wires.

     "You see, Watson," he remarked, "our evening has been by no means
     wasted.  Some of my most interesting cases have come to me in this
     way through Mycroft.  The problem which we have just listened to,
     although it can admit of but one explanation, has still some
     distinguishing features."

     "You have hopes of solving it?"

     "Well, knowing as much as we do, it will be singular indeed if we
     fail to discover the rest.  You must yourself have formed some theory
     which will explain the facts to which we have listened."

     "In a vague way, yes."

     "What was your idea, then?"

     "It seemed to me to be obvious that this Greek girl had been carried
     off by the young Englishman named Harold Latimer."

     "Carried off from where?"

     "Athens, perhaps."

     Sherlock Holmes shook his head.  "This young man could not talk a
     word of Greek.  The lady could talk English fairly well. 
     Inference--that she had been in England some little time, but he had
     not been in Greece."

     "Well, then, we will presume that she had come on a visit to England,
     and that this Harold had persuaded her to fly with him."

     "That is more probable."

     "Then the brother--for that, I fancy, must be the relationship--comes
     over from Greece to interfere.  He imprudently puts himself into the
     power of the young man and his older associate.  They seize him and
     use violence towards him in order to make him sign some papers to
     make over the girl's fortune--of which he may be trustee--to them. 
     This he refuses to do.  In order to negotiate with him they have to
     get an interpreter, and they pitch upon this Mr. Melas, having used
     some other one before.  The girl is not told of the arrival of her
     brother, and finds it out by the merest accident."

     "Excellent, Watson!" cried Holmes.  "I really fancy that you are not
     far from the truth.  You see that we hold all the cards, and we have
     only to fear some sudden act of violence on their part.  If they give
     us time we must have them."

     "But how can we find where this house lies?"

     "Well, if our conjecture is correct and the girl's name is or was
     Sophy Kratides, we should have no difficulty in tracing her.  That
     must be our main hope, for the brother is, of course, a complete
     stranger.  It is clear that some time has elapsed since this Harold
     established these relations with the girl--some weeks, at any
     rate--since the brother in Greece has had time to hear of it and come
     across.  If they have been living in the same place during this time,
     it is probable that we shall have some answer to Mycroft's
     advertisement."

     We had reached our house in Baker Street while we had been talking. 
     Holmes ascended the stair first, and as he opened the door of our
     room he gave a start of surprise.  Looking over his shoulder, I was
     equally astonished.  His brother Mycroft was sitting smoking in the
     arm-chair.

     "Come in, Sherlock!  Come in, sir," said he blandly, smiling at our
     surprised faces.  "You don't expect such energy from me, do you,
     Sherlock?  But somehow this case attracts me."

     "How did you get here?"

     "I passed you in a hansom."

     "There has been some new development?"

     "I had an answer to my advertisement."

     "Ah!"

     "Yes, it came within a few minutes of your leaving."

     "And to what effect?"

     Mycroft Holmes took out a sheet of paper.

     "Here it is," said he, "written with a J pen on royal cream paper by
     a middle-aged man with a weak constitution.

     "Sir [he says]:
     "In answer to your advertisement of to-day's date, I beg to inform
     you that I know the young lady in question very well.  If you should
     care to call upon me I could give you some particulars as to her
     painful history.  She is living at present at The Myrtles, Beckenham.
     "Yours faithfully,
     "J. Davenport.

     "He writes from Lower Brixton," said Mycroft Holmes.  "Do you not
     think that we might drive to him now, Sherlock, and learn these
     particulars?"

     "My dear Mycroft, the brother's life is more valuable than the
     sister's story.  I think we should call at Scotland Yard for
     Inspector Gregson, and go straight out to Beckenham.  We know that a
     man is being done to death, and every hour may be vital."

     "Better pick up Mr. Melas on our way," I suggested.  "We may need an
     interpreter."

     "Excellent," said Sherlock Holmes.  "Send the boy for a four-wheeler,
     and we shall be off at once."  He opened the table-drawer as he
     spoke, and I noticed that he slipped his revolver into his pocket. 
     "Yes," said he, in answer to my glance; "I should say from what we
     have heard, that we are dealing with a particularly dangerous gang."

     It was almost dark before we found ourselves in Pall Mall, at the
     rooms of Mr. Melas.  A gentleman had just called for him, and he was
     gone.

     "Can you tell me where?" asked Mycroft Holmes.

     "I don't know, sir," answered the woman who had opened the door; "I
     only know that he drove away with the gentleman in a carriage."

     "Did the gentleman give a name?"

     "No, sir."

     "He wasn't a tall, handsome, dark young man?"

     "Oh, no, sir.  He was a little gentleman, with glasses, thin in the
     face, but very pleasant in his ways, for he was laughing all the time
     that he was talking."

     "Come along!" cried Sherlock Holmes, abruptly.  "This grows serious,"
     he observed, as we drove to Scotland Yard.  "These men have got hold
     of Melas again.  He is a man of no physical courage, as they are well
     aware from their experience the other night.  This villain was able
     to terrorize him the instant that he got into his presence.  No doubt
     they want his professional services, but, having used him, they may
     be inclined to punish him for what they will regard as his
     treachery."

     Our hope was that, by taking train, we might get to Beckenham as soon
     or sooner than the carriage.  On reaching Scotland Yard, however, it
     was more than an hour before we could get Inspector Gregson and
     comply with the legal formalities which would enable us to enter the
     house.  It was a quarter to ten before we reached London Bridge, and
     half past before the four of us alighted on the Beckenham platform. 
     A drive of half a mile brought us to The Myrtles--a large, dark house
     standing back from the road in its own grounds.  Here we dismissed
     our cab, and made our way up the drive together.

     "The windows are all dark," remarked the inspector.  "The house seems
     deserted."

     "Our birds are flown and the nest empty," said Holmes.

     "Why do you say so?"

     "A carriage heavily loaded with luggage has passed out during the
     last hour."

     The inspector laughed.  "I saw the wheel-tracks in the light of the
     gate-lamp, but where does the luggage come in?"

     "You may have observed the same wheel-tracks going the other way. 
     But the outward-bound ones were very much deeper--so much so that we
     can say for a certainty that there was a very considerable weight on
     the carriage."

     "You get a trifle beyond me there," said the inspector, shrugging his
     shoulder.  "It will not be an easy door to force, but we will try if
     we cannot make some one hear us."

     He hammered loudly at the knocker and pulled at the bell, but without
     any success.  Holmes had slipped away, but he came back in a few
     minutes.

     "I have a window open," said he.

     "It is a mercy that you are on the side of the force, and not against
     it, Mr. Holmes," remarked the inspector, as he noted the clever way
     in which my friend had forced back the catch.  "Well, I think that
     under the circumstances we may enter without an invitation."

     One after the other we made our way into a large apartment, which was
     evidently that in which Mr. Melas had found himself.  The inspector
     had lit his lantern, and by its light we could see the two doors, the
     curtain, the lamp, and the suit of Japanese mail as he had described
     them.  On the table lay two glasses, and empty brandy-bottle, and the
     remains of a meal.

     "What is that?" asked Holmes, suddenly.

     We all stood still and listened.  A low moaning sound was coming from
     somewhere over our heads.  Holmes rushed to the door and out into the
     hall.  The dismal noise came from upstairs.  He dashed up, the
     inspector and I at his heels, while his brother Mycroft followed as
     quickly as his great bulk would permit.

     Three doors faced up upon the second floor, and it was from the
     central of these that the sinister sounds were issuing, sinking
     sometimes into a dull mumble and rising again into a shrill whine. 
     It was locked, but the key had been left on the outside.  Holmes
     flung open the door and rushed in, but he was out again in an
     instant, with his hand to his throat.

     "It's charcoal," he cried.  "Give it time.  It will clear."

     Peering in, we could see that the only light in the room came from a
     dull blue flame which flickered from a small brass tripod in the
     centre.  It threw a livid, unnatural circle upon the floor, while in
     the shadows beyond we saw the vague loom of two figures which
     crouched against the wall.  From the open door there reeked a
     horrible poisonous exhalation which set us gasping and coughing. 
     Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in the fresh air, and
     then, dashing into the room, he threw up the window and hurled the
     brazen tripod out into the garden.

     "We can enter in a minute," he gasped, darting out again.  "Where is
     a candle?  I doubt if we could strike a match in that atmosphere. 
     Hold the light at the door and we shall get them out, Mycroft. Now!"

     With a rush we got to the poisoned men and dragged them out into the
     well-lit hall.  Both of them were blue-lipped and insensible, with
     swollen, congested faces and protruding eyes.  Indeed, so distorted
     were their features that, save for his black beard and stout figure,
     we might have failed to recognize in one of them the Greek
     interpreter who had parted from us only a few hours before at the
     Diogenes Club.  His hands and feet were securely strapped together,
     and he bore over one eye the marks of a violent blow.  The other, who
     was secured in a similar fashion, was a tall man in the last stage of
     emaciation, with several strips of sticking-plaster arranged in a
     grotesque pattern over his face.  He had ceased to moan as we laid
     him down, and a glance showed me that for him at least our aid had
     come too late.  Mr. Melas, however, still lived, and in less than an
     hour, with the aid of ammonia and brandy I had the satisfaction of
     seeing him open his eyes, and of knowing that my hand had drawn him
     back from that dark valley in which all paths meet.

     It was a simple story which he had to tell, and one which did but
     confirm our own deductions.  His visitor, on entering his rooms, had
     drawn a life-preserver from his sleeve, and had so impressed him with
     the fear of instant and inevitable death that he had kidnapped him
     for the second time.  Indeed, it was almost mesmeric, the effect
     which this giggling ruffian had produced upon the unfortunate
     linguist, for he could not speak of him save with trembling hands and
     a blanched cheek.  He had been taken swiftly to Beckenham, and had
     acted as interpreter in a second interview, even more dramatic than
     the first, in which the two Englishmen had menaced their prisoner
     with instant death if he did not comply with their demands.  Finally,
     finding him proof against every threat, they had hurled him back into
     his prison, and after reproaching Melas with his treachery, which
     appeared from the newspaper advertisement, they had stunned him with
     a blow from a stick, and he remembered nothing more until he found us
     bending over him.

     And this was the singular case of the Grecian Interpreter, the
     explanation of which is still involved in some mystery.  We were able
     to find out, by communicating with the gentleman who had answered the
     advertisement, that the unfortunate young lady came of a wealthy
     Grecian family, and that she had been on a visit to some friends in
     England.  While there she had met a young man named Harold Latimer,
     who had acquired an ascendancy over her and had eventually persuaded
     her to fly with him.  Her friends, shocked at the event, had
     contented themselves with informing her brother at Athens, and had
     then washed their hands of the matter.  The brother, on his arrival
     in England, had imprudently placed himself in the power of Latimer
     and of his associate, whose name was Wilson Kemp--a man of the
     foulest antecedents. These two, finding that  through his ignorance
     of the language he was helpless in their hands, had kept him a
     prisoner, and had endeavored by cruelty and starvation to make him
     sign away his own and his sister's property.  They had kept him in
     the house without the girl's knowledge, and the plaster over the face
     had been for the purpose of making recognition difficult in case she
     should ever catch a glimpse of him.  Her feminine perception,
     however, had instantly seen through the disguise when, on the
     occasion of the interpreter's visit, she had seen him for the first
     time.  The poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was
     no one about the house except the man who acted as coachman, and his
     wife, both of whom were tools of the conspirators.  Finding that
     their secret was out, and that their prisoner was not to be coerced,
     the two villains with the girl had fled away at a few hours' notice
     from the furnished house which they had hired, having first, as they
     thought, taken vengeance both upon the man who had defied and the one
     who had betrayed them.

     Months afterwards a curious newspaper cutting reached us from
     Buda-Pesth.  It told how two Englishmen who had been traveling with a
     woman had met with a tragic end.  They had each been stabbed, it
     seems, and the Hungarian police were of opinion that they had
     quarreled and had inflicted mortal injuries upon each other.  Holmes,
     however, is, I fancy, of a different way of thinking, and holds to
     this day that, if one could find the Grecian girl, one might learn
     how the wrongs of herself and her brother came to be avenged.






                                THE NAVAL TREATY

     The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable
     by three cases of interest, in which I had the privilege of being
     associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods. I find
     them recorded in my notes under the headings of "The Adventure of the
     Second Stain," "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty," and "The
     Adventure of the Tired Captain." The first of these, however, deals
     with interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first
     families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to
     make it public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has
     ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or
     has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still
     retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he
     demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubugue of the
     Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of
     Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to
     be side-issues. The new century will have come, however, before the
     story can be safely told. Meanwhile I pass on to the second on my
     list, which promised also at one time to be of national importance,
     and was marked by several incidents which give it a quite unique
     character.

     During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad
     named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself, though he
     was two classes ahead of me. He was a very brilliant boy, and carried
     away every prize which the school had to offer, finishing his
     exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on to continue his
     triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I remember, extremely well
     connected, and even when we were all little boys together we knew
     that his mother's brother was Lord Holdhurst, the great conservative
     politician. This gaudy relationship did him little good at school. On
     the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him
     about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it
     was another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely
     that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won him
     a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed completely
     out of my mind until the following letter recalled his existence:

     Briarbrae, Woking.
     My dear Watson:
     I have no doubt that you can remember "Tadpole" Phelps, who was in
     the fifth form when you were in the third. It is possible even that
     you may have heard that through my uncle's influence I obtained a
     good appointment at the Foreign Office, and that I was in a situation
     of trust and honor until a horrible misfortune came suddenly to blast
     my career.
     There is no use writing of the details of that dreadful event. In the
     event of your acceding to my request it is probable that I shall have
     to narrate them to you. I have only just recovered from nine weeks of
     brain-fever, and am still exceedingly weak. Do you think that you
     could bring your friend Mr. Holmes down to see me? I should like to
     have his opinion of the case, though the authorities assure me that
     nothing more can be done. Do try to bring him down, and as soon as
     possible. Every minute seems an hour while I live in this state of
     horrible suspense. Assure him that if I have not asked his advice
     sooner it was not because I did not appreciate his talents, but
     because I have been off my head ever since the blow fell. Now I am
     clear again, though I dare not think of it too much for fear of a
     relapse. I am still so weak that I have to write, as you see, by
     dictating. Do try to bring him.
     Your old school-fellow,
     Percy Phelps.


Iteration: 24000
     "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "It was a dangerous, reckless
     attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having
     found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to
     be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
     could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was
     much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the
     missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of
     the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it
     into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put
     it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an
     effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that
     they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise
     they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was
     about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by
     the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and
     so changed the conversation."

     "Good heavens!" cried the Colonel, laughing, "do you mean to say all
     our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?"

     "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," cried I, looking in
     amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new
     phase of his astuteness.

     "It is an art which is often useful," said he. "When I recovered I
     managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of
     ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that
     I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper."

     "Oh, what an ass I have been!" I exclaimed.

     "I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,"
     said Holmes, laughing. "I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
     which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and
     having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind
     the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their
     attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I
     had hardly got the paper, however--which was, as I had expected, in
     one of them--when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
     believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and
     friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat
     now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get
     the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you
     see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair
     made them perfectly desperate.

     "I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive
     of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
     demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could
     have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against
     him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of
     everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two
     masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr. Acton's, and
     having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of
     exposure, to levy black-mail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a
     dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of
     positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was
     convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid
     of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had
     they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention
     to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion
     might never have been aroused."

     "And the note?" I asked.

     Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.

     [ Picture: Paper which reads: If you will only come around at quarter
     to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much
     surprise you and may be of the greatest service to you and also to
     Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone upon the matter ]

     "It is very much the sort of thing that I expected," said he. "Of
     course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between
     Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The results
     shows that the trap was skillfully baited. I am sure that you cannot
     fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p's and
     in the tails of the g's. The absence of the i-dots in the old man's
     writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest
     in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly
     return much invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow." 






                                 THE CROOKED MAN

     One summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my
     own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day's
     work had been an exhausting one.  My wife had already gone upstairs,
     and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told
     me that the servants had also retired.  I had risen from my seat and
     was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang
     of the bell.

     I looked at the clock.  It was a quarter to twelve.  This could not
     be a visitor at so late an hour.  A patient, evidently, and possibly
     an all-night sitting.  With a wry face I went out into the hall and
     opened the door.  To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood
     upon my step.

     "Ah, Watson," said he, "I hoped that I might not be too late to catch
     you."

     "My dear fellow, pray come in."

     "You look surprised, and no wonder!  Relieved, too, I fancy!  Hum! 
     You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then! 
     There's no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat.  It's easy to
     tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson.  You'll
     never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of
     carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve.  Could you put me up
     tonight?"

     "With pleasure."

     "You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that
     you have no gentleman visitor at present.  Your hat-stand proclaims
     as much."

     "I shall be delighted if you will stay."

     "Thank you.  I'll fill the vacant peg then.  Sorry to see that you've
     had the British workman in the house.  He's a token of evil.  Not the
     drains, I hope?"

     "No, the gas."

     "Ah!  He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum
     just where the light strikes it.  No, thank you, I had some supper at
     Waterloo, but I'll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure."

     I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and
     smoked for some time in silence.  I was well aware that nothing but
     business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour,
     so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.

     "I see that you are professionally rather busy just now," said he,
     glancing very keenly across at me.

     "Yes, I've had a busy day," I answered.  "It may seem very foolish in
     your eyes," I added, "but really I don't know how you deduced it."

     Holmes chuckled to himself.

     "I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson," said
     he.  "When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long
     one you use a hansom.  As I perceive that your boots, although used,
     are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy
     enough to justify the hansom."

     "Excellent!" I cried.

     "Elementary," said he.  "It is one of those instances where the
     reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
     neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little point which is
     the basis of the deduction.  The same may be said, my dear fellow,
     for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted
     to the reader.  Now, at present I am in the position of these same
     readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the
     strangest cases which ever perplexed a man's brain, and yet I lack
     the one or two which are needful to complete my theory.  But I'll
     have them, Watson, I'll have them!"  His eyes kindled and a slight
     flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant the veil had lifted
     upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. When I
     glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which
     had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.

     "The problem presents features of interest," said he.  "I may even
     say exceptional features of interest.  I have already looked into the
     matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution.  If
     you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable
     service to me."

     "I should be delighted."

     "Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?"

     "I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice."

     "Very good.  I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo."

     "That would give me time."

     "Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what
     has happened, and of what remains to be done."

     "I was sleepy before you came.  I am quite wakeful now."

     "I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting
     anything vital to the case.  It is conceivable that you may even have
     read some account of the matter.  It is the supposed murder of
     Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am
     investigating."

     "I have heard nothing of it."

     "It has not excited much attention yet, except locally.  The facts
     are only two days old.  Briefly they are these:

     "The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish
     regiments in the British army.  It did wonders both in the Crimea and
     the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every
     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James
     Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
     to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
     so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a
     musket.

     "Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and
     his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
     a former color-sergeant in the same corps.  There was, therefore, as
     can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple
     (for they were still young) found themselves in their new
     surroundings.  They appear, however, to have quickly adapted
     themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
     popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his
     brother officers.  I may add that she was a woman of great beauty,
     and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty
     years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy
     one.  Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that
     he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.  On the
     whole, he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than
     his wife's to Barclay.  He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from
     her for a day.  She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful,
     was less obtrusively affectionate.  But they were regarded in the
     regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.  There was
     absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for
     the tragedy which was to follow.

     "Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in
     his character.  He was a dashing, jovial old solder in his usual
     mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself
     capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness.  This side of
     his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his
     wife.  Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and three out of
     five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular
     sort of depression which came upon him at times.  As the major
     expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if
     by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gaieties and
     chaff of the mess-table.  For days on end, when the mood was on him,
     he has been sunk in the deepest gloom.  This and a certain tinge of
     superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his
     brother officers had observed.  The latter peculiarity took the form
     of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark.  This
     puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often
     given rise to comment and conjecture.

     "The first battalion of the Royal Munsters (which is the old 117th)
     has been stationed at Aldershot for some years.  The married officers
     live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time
     occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the north
     camp.  The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it
     is not more than thirty yards from the high-road.  A coachman and two
     maids form the staff of servants.  These with their master and
     mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no
     children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.

     "Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of
     last Monday.

     "Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church,
     and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the
     Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt
     Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off
     clothing.  A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at
     eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be
     present at it.  When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman
     to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him
     that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss
     Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went
     off together to their meeting.  It lasted forty minutes, and at a
     quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss
     Morrison at her door as she passed.

     "There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine.  This
     faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the
     lawn.  The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the
     highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it.  It was into this
     room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return.  The blinds were not
     down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay
     herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the
     house-maid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to
     her usual habits.  The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room,
     but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the
     morning-room.  The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it.  He
     was never seen again alive.

     "The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten
     minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to
     hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. 
     She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle,
     but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.  Naturally
     enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the
     coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was
     still raging.  They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard,
     those of Barclay and of his wife.  Barclay's remarks were subdued and
     abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners.  The
     lady's, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her
     voice could be plainly heard.  'You coward!' she repeated over and
     over again.  'What can be done now?  What can be done now?  Give me
     back my life.  I will never so much as breathe the same air with you
     again!  You coward!  You Coward!'  Those were scraps of her
     conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man's voice,
     with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman.  Convinced that
     some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove
     to force it, while scream after scream issued from within.  He was
     unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too
     distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him.  A sudden
     thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and
     round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open.  One side
     of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the
     summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room.  His
     mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a
     couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-chair, and
     his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the
     unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.

     "Naturally, the coachman's first thought, on finding that he could do
     nothing for his master, was to open the door.  But here an unexpected
     and singular difficulty presented itself.  The key was not in the
     inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. 
     He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained
     the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned.  The lady,
     against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to
     her room, still in a state of insensibility.  The Colonel's body was
     then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the
     scene of the tragedy.

     "The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was
     found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his
     head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt
     weapon.  Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have
     been.  Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club
     of hard carved wood with a bone handle.  The Colonel possessed a
     varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in
     which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that his
     club was among his trophies.  The servants deny having seen it
     before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is
     possible that it may have been overlooked.  Nothing else of
     importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the
     inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay's person nor upon
     that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to
     be found.  The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from
     Aldershot.

     "That was the state of things, Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning
     I, at the request of Major Murphy, went down to Aldershot to
     supplement the efforts of the police.  I think that you will
     acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my
     observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more
     extraordinary than would at first sight appear.

     "Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only
     succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated.  One
     other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the
     housemaid.  You will remember that on hearing the sound of the
     quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants.  On that
     first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her
     master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly
     anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they
     had fallen out.  On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she
     heard the word David uttered twice by the lady.  The point is of the
     utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden
     quarrel.  The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.

     "There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest
     impression both upon the servants and the police.  This was the
     contortion of the Colonel's face.  It had set, according to their
     account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a
     human countenance is capable of assuming.  More than one person
     fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect.  It was
     quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused
     him the utmost horror.  This, of course, fitted in well enough with
     the police theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a
     murderous attack upon him.  Nor was the fact of the wound being on
     the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have
     turned to avoid the blow.  No information could be got from the lady
     herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of
     brain-fever.

     "From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember went
     out that evening with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge of
     what it was which had caused the ill-humor in which her companion had
     returned.

     "Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over
     them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which
     were merely incidental.  There could be no question that the most
     distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular
     disappearance of the door-key.  A most careful search had failed to
     discover it in the room.  Therefore it must have been taken from it. 
     But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel's wife could have taken it. 
     That was perfectly clear.  Therefore a third person must have entered
     the room.  And that third person could only have come in through the
     window.  It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and
     the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious
     individual.  You know my methods, Watson.  There was not one of them
     which I did not apply to the inquiry.  And it ended by my discovering
     traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected. 
     There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming
     from the road.  I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of
     his foot-marks:  one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had
     climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon
     the stained boards near the window where he had entered.  He had
     apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper
     than his heels.  But it was not the man who surprised me.  It was his
     companion."

     "His companion!"

     Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and
     carefully unfolded it upon his knee.

     "What do you make of that?" he asked.

     The paper was covered with the tracings of the foot-marks of some
     small animal.  It had five well-marked foot-pads, an indication of
     long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as  a
     dessert-spoon.

     "It's a dog," said I.

     "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?  I found distinct
     traces that this creature had done so."

     "A monkey, then?"

     "But it is not the print of a monkey."

     "What can it be, then?"

     "Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar
     with.  I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements.  Here
     are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless.  You
     see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. 
     Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not
     much less than two feet long--probably more if there is any tail. 
     But now observe this other measurement.  The animal has been moving,
     and we have the length of its stride.  In each case it is only about
     three inches.  You have an indication, you see, of a long body with
     very short legs attached to it.  It has not been considerate enough
     to leave any of its hair behind it.  But its general shape must be
     what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is
     carnivorous."

     "How do you deduce that?"

     "Because it ran up the curtain.  A canary's cage was hanging in the
     window, and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird."

     "Then what was the beast?"

     "Ah, if I could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving
     the case.  On the whole, it was probably some creature of the weasel
     and stoat tribe--and yet it is larger than any of these that I have
     seen."

     "But what had it to do with the crime?"

     "That, also, is still obscure.  But we have learned a good deal, you
     perceive.  We know that a man stood in the road looking at the
     quarrel between the Barclays--the blinds were up and the room
     lighted.  We know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the
     room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the
     Colonel or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down from
     sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of
     the fender.  Finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder
     carried away the key with him when he left."

     "Your discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure that it
     was before," said I.

     "Quite so.  They undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper
     than was at first conjectured.  I thought the matter over, and I came
     to the conclusion that I must approach the case from another aspect. 
     But really, Watson, I am keeping you up, and I might just as well
     tell you all this on our way to Aldershot to-morrow."

     "Thank you, you have gone rather too far to stop."

     "It is quite certain that when Mrs. Barclay left the house at
     half-past seven she was on good terms with her husband.  She was
     never, as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she
     was heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel in a friendly
     fashion.  Now, it was equally certain that, immediately on her
     return, she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see
     her husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman will, and finally,
     on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. 
     Therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine
     o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him.  But

Iteration: 25000
     "We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the
     Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round
     his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from
     the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him.
     His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the
     greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia,
     which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its
     decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. The
     other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia.
     He has broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his
     track. Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man
     himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the
     fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in
     the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.
     Sherlock Holmes?"

     Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.

     "Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!" he cried. "But I didn't quite
     follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts."

     "The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After
     all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is
     the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am
     gathering all the threads into my hands."

     "And the next stage?"

     "Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
     quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on
     the charge of murder. Will you come with us?"

     "I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can't
     say for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon a
     factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great
     hopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will
     come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the
     heels."

     "In the Italian quarter?"

     "No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him.
     If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I'll promise
     to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be
     done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do
     us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and
     it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You'll dine with
     us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time
     for us to start. In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you
     would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send, and
     it is important that it should go at once."

     Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old
     daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at
     last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said
     nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. For my
     own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had
     traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I could
     not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood clearly
     that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon
     the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick.
     No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act,
     and I could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had
     inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow
     the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not
     surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with
     me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his
     favourite weapon.

     A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
     spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was
     directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed
     with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. In the light
     of a street lamp we read "Laburnum Villa" upon the gate-post of one
     of them. The occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was
     dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single
     blurred circle on to the garden path. The wooden fence which
     depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by
     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the

     me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his
     favourite weapon.

     A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
     the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of
     having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax
     these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their
     opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.

     Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's
     mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of
     revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no
     room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things
     practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not
     stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and
     want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog
     among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet
     such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that
     that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the
     old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money
     enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.

     His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a
     combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the
     mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory
     of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on
     that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave.
     Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City,
     careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he
     knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There
     had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some
     of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the
     authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a
     certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become
     Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one
     knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed
     to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had
     departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was
     comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their
     whereabouts.

     Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of
     revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never
     faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked
     out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to
     town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed
     into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on,
     a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon
     which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded.
     It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told
     him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit
     of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance
     all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his
     window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder
     in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by
     Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to
     him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and
     hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into
     custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some
     weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that
     Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had
     departed for Europe.

     Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred
     urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and
     for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his
     approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in
     him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to
     city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking
     the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for
     Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just
     set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days
     late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded
     in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do
     better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in
     Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.





          CHAPTER VI
          A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.


     Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any
     ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself
     powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes
     that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. "I guess you're going
     to take me to the police-station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.
     "My cab's at the door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it.
     I'm not so light to lift as I used to be."

     Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this
     proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner
     at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his
     ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself
     that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself,
     as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man;
     and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and
     energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.

     "If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you
     are the man for it," he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at
     my fellow-lodger. "The way you kept on my trail was a caution."

     "You had better come with me," said Holmes to the two detectives.

     "I can drive you," said Lestrade.

     "Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have
     taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us."

     I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made
     no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been
     his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the
     horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We
     were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down
     our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had
     been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who
     went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. "The prisoner will
     be put before the magistrates in the course of the week," he said;
     "in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you
     wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and
     may be used against you."

     "I've got a good deal to say," our prisoner said slowly. "I want to
     tell you gentlemen all about it."

     "Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?" asked the Inspector.

     "I may never be tried," he answered. "You needn't look startled. It
     isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?" He turned his
     fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.

     "Yes; I am," I answered.

     "Then put your hand here," he said, with a smile, motioning with his
     manacled wrists towards his chest.

     I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing
     and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest
     seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when
     some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could
     hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same
     source.

     "Why," I cried, "you have an aortic aneurism!"

     "That's what they call it," he said, placidly. "I went to a Doctor
     last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before
     many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from
     over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've
     done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like
     to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be
     remembered as a common cut-throat."

     The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to
     the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.

     "Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?" the former
     asked.

     "Most certainly there is," I answered.

     "In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to
     take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty, sir, to
     give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down."

     "I'll sit down, with your leave," the prisoner said, suiting the
     action to the word. "This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and
     the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the
     brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I
     say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no
     consequence to me."

     With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began
     the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace
     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I
     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's
     words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.

     "It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's
     enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a
     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their
     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,
     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any
     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should
     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done
     the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my
     place.

     "That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.
     She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart
     over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed
     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his
     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I
     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his
     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to
     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is
     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and
     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left
     for me to hope for, or to desire.

     "They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving
     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a
     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain
     sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for
     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along
     somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that
     of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most
     confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted
     the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.

     "It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were
     living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across
     them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other
     side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them
     at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their
     recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my
     opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.

     "They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then
     they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or
     late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get
     behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long
     as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.

     "They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there
     was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out
     alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind
     them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was
     drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I
     watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but
     I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost
     come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a
     little too soon and leave my work undone.

     "At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as
     the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive
     up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a
     time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up
     my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for
     I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston
     Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed
     them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train,
     and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be
     another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but
     Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in
     the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them.
     Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that
     if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His
     companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had
     resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a
     delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what
     Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and
     reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that
     he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it
     up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the
     last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which
     Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven,
     and made his way out of the station.

     "The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my
     enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but
     singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue
     precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction
     in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that
     strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans
     arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who
     had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It
     chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in
     looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of
     one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and
     returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a
     duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one
     spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from
     interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult
     problem which I had now to solve.

     "He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops,
     staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out
     he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was
     a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so
     close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the
     whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of
     streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the
     Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his
     intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab
     a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom
     drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets
     dry with the talking."

     I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.

     "That's better," he said. "Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour,
     or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling
     inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men
     I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this
     London?"

     "I don't miss much, Mr. Holmes. Maybe I learned that from you. Yes, I
          First Report of Dr. Watson

     "Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and
     choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination,
     but we have always some material basis on which to start our
     speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am
     almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."

     "How in the world can you say that?"

     "If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the
     that you saw all that I did."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "Yes, sir."

     "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
     observes. Where do you think that I have been?"

     "A fixture also."

     "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."

     "In spirit?"

     "Exactly. My body has remained in this arm-chair and has, I regret to
     observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
     incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
     Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my
     spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could
     find my way about."

     "A large scale map, I presume?"

     "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
     "Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is
     Baskerville Hall in the middle."

     "They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then
     they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or
     late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get
     behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long
     as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.

     "They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there
     was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out
     alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind
     them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was
     drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I
     watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but
     I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost
     come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a
     little too soon and leave my work undone.

     "At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as
     the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive
     up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a
     time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up
     my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for
     I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston
     Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed
     them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train,
     and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be
     another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but
     Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in
     the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them.
     Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that
     if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His
     companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had
     resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a
     delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what
     Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and
     reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that
     he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it
     up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the
     last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which
     Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven,
     and made his way out of the station.

     "The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my
     enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but
     singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue
     precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction
     in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that
     strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans
     arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who
     had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It
     chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in
     looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of
     one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and
     returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a
     duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one
     spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from
     interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult
     problem which I had now to solve.

     "He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops,
     staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out
     he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was
     a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so
     close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the
     whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of
     streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the
     Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his
     intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab
     a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom
     drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets
     dry with the talking."

     I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.

     "What did he do?"

     "He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin
     when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the
     great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will
     find some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse
     me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides."

     A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant
     Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit
     of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire,
     and my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft
     to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes
     and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge
     moth himself. I was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of
     admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should
     lose his footing in the treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of
     steps, and turning round found a woman near me upon the path. She had
     come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the
     position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until
     she was quite close.

     I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been
     told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I
     remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty.
     The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most
     uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast between
     brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair
     and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have
     seen in England--slim, elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut
     face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for
     the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her
     perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange
     apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother
     as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised
     my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark, when her own
     words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.

     "Go back!" she said. "Go straight back to London, instantly."

     I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me,
     and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.

     "Why should I go back?" I asked.

     "I cannot explain." She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious
     lisp in her utterance. "But for God's sake do what I ask you. Go back
     and never set foot upon the moor again."

     "But I have only just come."

     "Man, man!" she cried. "Can you not tell when a warning is for your
     own good? Go back to London! Start to-night! Get away from this place
     at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have
     said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mares-tails
     yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course,
     you are rather late to see the beauties of the place."

     Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard
     and flushed with his exertions.

     "Halloa, Beryl!" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his
     greeting was not altogether a cordial one.

     "Well, Jack, you are very hot."

     "Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in
     the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!" He spoke
     unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the
     girl to me.

     "You have introduced yourselves, I can see."

     "Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see
     the true beauties of the moor."

     "Why, who do you think this is?"

     "I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville."

     "No, no," said I. "Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is
     Dr. Watson."

     A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. "We have been
     talking at cross purposes," said she.

     "Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother remarked with
     the same questioning eyes.

     "I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a
     visitor," said she. "It cannot much matter to him whether it is early
     or late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see
     Merripit House?"

     A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm
     of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair
     and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the
     trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the
     effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted
     by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in
     keeping with the house. Inside, however, there were large rooms
     furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste
     of the lady. As I looked from their windows at the interminable
     granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could
     not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man
     and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.

     "Queer spot to choose, is it not?" said he as if in answer to my
     thought. "And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we
     not, Beryl?"

     "Quite happy," said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her
     words.

     "I had a school," said Stapleton. "It was in the north country. The
     work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but
     the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young
     minds, and of impressing them with one's own character and ideals,
     was very dear to me. However, the fates were against us. A serious
     epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died. It never
     recovered from the blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably
     swallowed up. And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charming
     companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune,
     for, with my strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an
     unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature
     as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon your head by
     your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window."

     "It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less
     for you, perhaps, than for your sister."

     "No, no, I am never dull," said she, quickly.

     "We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting
     neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. Poor
     Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him well, and
     miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if
     I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir
     Henry?"

     "I am sure that he would be delighted."

     "Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in
     our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he
     becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs,
     Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is
     the most complete one in the south-west of England. By the time that
     you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready."

     But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,
     the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been
     associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things
     tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or
     less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct
     warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness
     that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it.
     I resisted all pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon
     my return journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.

     It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those
     who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see
     Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face
     was beautifully flushed with her exertions, and she held her hand to
     her side.

     "I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson," said
     she. "I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my
     brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the
     stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please
     forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you."

     "But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton," said I. "I am Sir Henry's
     friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why
     it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to
     London."

     "A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will
     understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do."

     "No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in
     your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever
     since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.
     Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green
     patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point
     the track. Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will
     promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry."

     An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face,
     but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.

     "You make too much of it, Dr. Watson," said she. "My brother and I
     were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very
     intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He
     was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and
     when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some
     grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed
     therefore when another member of the family came down to live here,
     and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run.
     That was all which I intended to convey.

     "But what is the danger?"

     "You know the story of the hound?"

     "I do not believe in such nonsense."

     "But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away
     from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is
     wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?"

     "Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature. I
     fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than
     this it would be impossible to get him to move."

     "I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything
     definite."

     "I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no
     more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish
     your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he,
     or anyone else, could object."

     "My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks
     it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very
     angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir
     Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more.
     I must get back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you.
     Good-bye!" She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the
     scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears,
     pursued my way to Baskerville Hall.





          CHAPTER VIII
          First Report of Dr. Watson


     From this point onward I will follow the course of events by
     transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before
     me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
     as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more
     accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events,
     can possibly do.

     Baskerville Hall, October 13th.

     My dear Holmes:
     My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to
     date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of
     the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the
     moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm.
     When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of
     modern England behind you, but on the other hand you are conscious
     everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On
     all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk,
     with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have
     marked their temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against
     the scarred hill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and if you
     were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door
     fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would
     feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The
     strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must
     always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I
     could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were
     forced to accept that which none other would occupy.

     All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and
     will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.
     I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun
     moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,
     return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.

     If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because
     up to to-day there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very
     surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due
     course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the
     other factors in the situation.

     One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped
     convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he
     has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely
     householders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his
     flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard
     of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon
     the moor during all that time. Of course, so far as his concealment
     goes there is no difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would
     give him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were
     to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore,
     that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in
     consequence.

     We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take
     good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments
     when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.
     There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother,
     the latter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands
     of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal, if he could
     once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their
     situation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over
     to sleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.

     The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a
     considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered
     at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like
     him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is
     something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular
     contrast to her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the
     idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over
     her, for I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as
     if seeking approbation for what she said. I trust that he is kind to
     her. There is a dry glitter in his eyes, and a firm set of his thin
     lips, which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You
     would find him an interesting study.

     He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very
     next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of
     the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an
     excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal
     that it might have suggested the story. We found a short valley
     between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over
     with the white cotton grass. In the middle of it rose two great
     stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end, until they looked like
     the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. In every way it
     corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy. Sir Henry was much
     interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really
     believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in
     the affairs of men. He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was
     very much in earnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it
     was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would
     not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings
     of the baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had
     suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression
     that he shared the popular view upon the matter.

     On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was
     there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From
     the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted
     by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He
     referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then
     hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the
     brother and sister. They dine here to-night, and there is some talk
     of our going to them next week. One would imagine that such a match
     would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once
     caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir
     Henry has been paying some attention to his sister. He is much
     attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her,
     but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in
     the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that
     he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have
     several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from
     being tête-à-tête. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow
     Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a
     love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity
     would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.

     The other day--Thursday, to be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched with
     us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down, and has got a
     prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was there
     such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came in
     afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the Yew Alley, at Sir
     Henry's request, to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that
     fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the Yew Alley, between two
     high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either
     side. At the far end is an old tumble-down summer-house. Half-way
     down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It
     is a white wooden gate with a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I
     remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that
     had occurred. As the old man stood there he saw something coming
     across the moor, something which terrified him so that he lost his
     wits, and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion.
     There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what?
     A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and
     monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,
     watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim and
     vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it.

     One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
     Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of
     us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His
     passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in
     litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is
     equally ready to take up either side of a question, so that it is no
     wonder that he has found it a costly amusement. Sometimes he will
     shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it. At
     others he will with his own hands tear down some other man's gate and
     declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial, defying
     the owner to prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old
     manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes
     in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them,
     so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village
     street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit. He
     is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which
     will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his
     sting and leave him harmless for the future. Apart from the law he
     seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because
     you were particular that I should send some description of the people
     who surround us. He is curiously employed at present, for, being an
     amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies
     upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the
     hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would
     confine his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours
     that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave without
     the consent of the next-of-kin, because he dug up the Neolithic skull
     in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives from being
     monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed.

     And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
     Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end
     on that which is most important and tell you more about the
     Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development of last
     night.

     First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in
     order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already
     explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test
     was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told
     Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright
     fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the
     telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had.

     "Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?" asked Sir Henry.

     Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.

     "No," said he, "I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife
     brought it up to me."

     "Did you answer it yourself?"

     "No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it."

     In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.

     "I could not quite understand the object of your questions this
     morning, Sir Henry," said he. "I trust that they do not mean that I
     have done anything to forfeit your confidence?"

     Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by
     giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit
     having now all arrived.

     Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person,
     very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical.
     You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told
     you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and
     since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her
     face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if
     she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect
     Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there
     was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but
     the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.

     And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am
     not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this
     house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two
     in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I
     rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was
     trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly
     down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and
     trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the
     outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very
     slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably
     guilty and furtive in his whole appearance.

     I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs
     round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I
     waited until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When
     I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther
     corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open
     door that he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are
     unfurnished and unoccupied, so that his expedition became more
     mysterious than ever. The light shone steadily as if he were standing
     motionless. I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and
     peeped round the corner of the door.

     Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against
     the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face
     seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the
     blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood watching intently.
     Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out
     the light. Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly
     came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey.
     Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key
     turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came.
     What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business
     going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to
     the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked
     me to furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir
     Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon
     my observations of last night. I will not speak about it just now,
     but it should make my next report interesting reading.





          CHAPTER IX
          Second Report of Dr. Watson

Iteration: 27000
     "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "It was a dangerous, reckless
     attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having
     found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to
     be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
     could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was
     much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the
     missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of
     the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it
     into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put
     it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an
     effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that
     they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise
     they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was
     about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by
     the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and
     so changed the conversation."

     "Good heavens!" cried the Colonel, laughing, "do you mean to say all
     our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?"

     "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," cried I, looking in
     amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new
     phase of his astuteness.

     "It is an art which is often useful," said he. "When I recovered I
     managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of
     ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that
     I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper."

     "Oh, what an ass I have been!" I exclaimed.

     "I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,"
     said Holmes, laughing. "I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
     which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and
     having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind
     the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their
     attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I
     had hardly got the paper, however--which was, as I had expected, in
     one of them--when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
     believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and
     friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat
     now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get
     the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you
     see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair
     made them perfectly desperate.

     "I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive
     of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
     demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could
     have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against
     him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of
     everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two
     masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr. Acton's, and
     having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of
     exposure, to levy black-mail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a
     dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of
     positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was
     convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid
     of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had
     they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention
     to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion
     might never have been aroused."

     "And the note?" I asked.

     Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.

     [ Picture: Paper which reads: If you will only come around at quarter
     to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much
     surprise you and may be of the greatest service to you and also to
     Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone upon the matter ]

     "It is very much the sort of thing that I expected," said he. "Of
     course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between
     Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The results
     shows that the trap was skillfully baited. I am sure that you cannot
     fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p's and
     in the tails of the g's. The absence of the i-dots in the old man's
     writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest
     in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly
     return much invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow." 






                                 THE CROOKED MAN

     One summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my
     own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day's
     work had been an exhausting one.  My wife had already gone upstairs,
     and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told
     me that the servants had also retired.  I had risen from my seat and
     was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang
     of the bell.

     I looked at the clock.  It was a quarter to twelve.  This could not
     be a visitor at so late an hour.  A patient, evidently, and possibly
     an all-night sitting.  With a wry face I went out into the hall and
     opened the door.  To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood
     upon my step.

     "Ah, Watson," said he, "I hoped that I might not be too late to catch
     you."

     "My dear fellow, pray come in."

     "You look surprised, and no wonder!  Relieved, too, I fancy!  Hum! 
     You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then! 
     There's no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat.  It's easy to
     tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson.  You'll
     never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of
     carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve.  Could you put me up
     tonight?"

     "With pleasure."

     "You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that
     you have no gentleman visitor at present.  Your hat-stand proclaims
     as much."

     "I shall be delighted if you will stay."

     "Thank you.  I'll fill the vacant peg then.  Sorry to see that you've
     had the British workman in the house.  He's a token of evil.  Not the
     drains, I hope?"

     "No, the gas."

     "Ah!  He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum
     just where the light strikes it.  No, thank you, I had some supper at
     Waterloo, but I'll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure."

     I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and
     smoked for some time in silence.  I was well aware that nothing but
     business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour,
     so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.

     "I see that you are professionally rather busy just now," said he,
     glancing very keenly across at me.

     "Yes, I've had a busy day," I answered.  "It may seem very foolish in
     your eyes," I added, "but really I don't know how you deduced it."

     Holmes chuckled to himself.

     "I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson," said
     he.  "When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long
     one you use a hansom.  As I perceive that your boots, although used,
     are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy
     enough to justify the hansom."

     "Excellent!" I cried.

     "Elementary," said he.  "It is one of those instances where the
     reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
     neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little point which is
     the basis of the deduction.  The same may be said, my dear fellow,
     for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted
     to the reader.  Now, at present I am in the position of these same
     readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the
     strangest cases which ever perplexed a man's brain, and yet I lack
     the one or two which are needful to complete my theory.  But I'll
     have them, Watson, I'll have them!"  His eyes kindled and a slight
     flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant the veil had lifted
     upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. When I
     glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which
     had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.

     "The problem presents features of interest," said he.  "I may even
     say exceptional features of interest.  I have already looked into the
     matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution.  If
     you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable
     service to me."

     "I should be delighted."

     "Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?"

     "I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice."

     "Very good.  I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo."

     "That would give me time."

     "Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what
     has happened, and of what remains to be done."

     "I was sleepy before you came.  I am quite wakeful now."

     "I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting
     anything vital to the case.  It is conceivable that you may even have
     read some account of the matter.  It is the supposed murder of
     Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am
     investigating."

     "I have heard nothing of it."

     "It has not excited much attention yet, except locally.  The facts
     are only two days old.  Briefly they are these:

     "The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish
     regiments in the British army.  It did wonders both in the Crimea and
     the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every
     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James
     Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
     to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
     so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a
     musket.

     "Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and
     his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
     a former color-sergeant in the same corps.  There was, therefore, as
     can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple
     (for they were still young) found themselves in their new
     surroundings.  They appear, however, to have quickly adapted
     themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
     popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his
     brother officers.  I may add that she was a woman of great beauty,
     and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty
     years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy
     one.  Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that
     he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.  On the
     whole, he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than
     his wife's to Barclay.  He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from
     her for a day.  She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful,
     was less obtrusively affectionate.  But they were regarded in the
     regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.  There was
     absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for
     the tragedy which was to follow.

     "Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in
     his character.  He was a dashing, jovial old solder in his usual
     mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself
     capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness.  This side of
     his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his
     wife.  Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and three out of
     five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular
     sort of depression which came upon him at times.  As the major
     expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if
     by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gaieties and
     chaff of the mess-table.  For days on end, when the mood was on him,
     he has been sunk in the deepest gloom.  This and a certain tinge of
     superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his
     brother officers had observed.  The latter peculiarity took the form
     of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark.  This
     puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often
     given rise to comment and conjecture.

     "The first battalion of the Royal Munsters (which is the old 117th)
     has been stationed at Aldershot for some years.  The married officers
     live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time
     occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the north
     camp.  The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it
     is not more than thirty yards from the high-road.  A coachman and two
     maids form the staff of servants.  These with their master and
     mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no
     children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.

     "Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of
     last Monday.

     "Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church,
     and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the
     Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt
     Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off
     clothing.  A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at
     eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be
     present at it.  When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman
     to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him
     that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss
     Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went
     off together to their meeting.  It lasted forty minutes, and at a
     quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss
     Morrison at her door as she passed.

     "There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine.  This
     faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the
     lawn.  The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the
     highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it.  It was into this
     room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return.  The blinds were not
     down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay
     herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the
     house-maid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to
     her usual habits.  The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room,
     but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the
     morning-room.  The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it.  He
     was never seen again alive.

     "The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten
     minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to
     hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. 
     She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle,
     but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.  Naturally
     enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the
     coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was
     still raging.  They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard,
     those of Barclay and of his wife.  Barclay's remarks were subdued and
     abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners.  The
     lady's, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her
     voice could be plainly heard.  'You coward!' she repeated over and
     over again.  'What can be done now?  What can be done now?  Give me
     back my life.  I will never so much as breathe the same air with you
     again!  You coward!  You Coward!'  Those were scraps of her
     conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man's voice,
     with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman.  Convinced that
     some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove
     to force it, while scream after scream issued from within.  He was
     unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too
     distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him.  A sudden
     thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and
     round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open.  One side
     of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the
     summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room.  His
     mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a
     couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-chair, and
     his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the
     unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.

     "Naturally, the coachman's first thought, on finding that he could do
     nothing for his master, was to open the door.  But here an unexpected
     and singular difficulty presented itself.  The key was not in the
     inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. 
     He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained
     the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned.  The lady,
     against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to
     her room, still in a state of insensibility.  The Colonel's body was
     then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the
     scene of the tragedy.

     "The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was
     found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his
     head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt
     weapon.  Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have
     been.  Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club
     of hard carved wood with a bone handle.  The Colonel possessed a
     varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in
     which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that his
     club was among his trophies.  The servants deny having seen it
     before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is
     possible that it may have been overlooked.  Nothing else of
     importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the
     inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay's person nor upon
     that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to
     be found.  The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from
     Aldershot.

     "That was the state of things, Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning
     I, at the request of Major Murphy, went down to Aldershot to
     supplement the efforts of the police.  I think that you will
     acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my
     observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more
     extraordinary than would at first sight appear.

     "Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only
     succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated.  One
     other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the
     housemaid.  You will remember that on hearing the sound of the
     quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants.  On that
     first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her
     master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly
     anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they
     had fallen out.  On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she
     heard the word David uttered twice by the lady.  The point is of the
     utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden
     quarrel.  The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.

     "There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest
     impression both upon the servants and the police.  This was the
     contortion of the Colonel's face.  It had set, according to their
     account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a
     human countenance is capable of assuming.  More than one person
     fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect.  It was
     quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused
     him the utmost horror.  This, of course, fitted in well enough with
     the police theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a
     murderous attack upon him.  Nor was the fact of the wound being on
     the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have
     turned to avoid the blow.  No information could be got from the lady
     herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of
     brain-fever.

     "From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember went
     out that evening with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge of
     what it was which had caused the ill-humor in which her companion had
     returned.

     "Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over
     them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which
     were merely incidental.  There could be no question that the most
     distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular
     disappearance of the door-key.  A most careful search had failed to
     discover it in the room.  Therefore it must have been taken from it. 
     But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel's wife could have taken it. 
     That was perfectly clear.  Therefore a third person must have entered
     the room.  And that third person could only have come in through the
     window.  It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and
     the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious
     individual.  You know my methods, Watson.  There was not one of them
     which I did not apply to the inquiry.  And it ended by my discovering
     traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected. 
     climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon
     the stained boards near the window where he had entered.  He had
     apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper
     than his heels.  But it was not the man who surprised me.  It was his
     companion."

     "His companion!"

     Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and
     carefully unfolded it upon his knee.

     "What do you make of that?" he asked.

     The paper was covered with the tracings of the foot-marks of some
     small animal.  It had five well-marked foot-pads, an indication of
     long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as  a
     dessert-spoon.

     "It's a dog," said I.

     "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?  I found distinct
     traces that this creature had done so."

     "A monkey, then?"

     "But it is not the print of a monkey."

     "What can it be, then?"

     "Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar
     with.  I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements.  Here
     are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless.  You
     see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. 
     Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not
     much less than two feet long--probably more if there is any tail. 
     But now observe this other measurement.  The animal has been moving,
     and we have the length of its stride.  In each case it is only about
     three inches.  You have an indication, you see, of a long body with
     very short legs attached to it.  It has not been considerate enough
     to leave any of its hair behind it.  But its general shape must be
     what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is
     carnivorous."

     "How do you deduce that?"

     "Because it ran up the curtain.  A canary's cage was hanging in the
     window, and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird."

     "Then what was the beast?"

     "Ah, if I could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving
     the case.  On the whole, it was probably some creature of the weasel
     and stoat tribe--and yet it is larger than any of these that I have
     seen."

     "But what had it to do with the crime?"

     "That, also, is still obscure.  But we have learned a good deal, you
     perceive.  We know that a man stood in the road looking at the
     quarrel between the Barclays--the blinds were up and the room
     lighted.  We know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the
     room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the
     Colonel or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down from
     sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of
     the fender.  Finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder
     carried away the key with him when he left."

     "Your discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure that it
     was before," said I.

     "Quite so.  They undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper
     than was at first conjectured.  I thought the matter over, and I came
     to the conclusion that I must approach the case from another aspect. 
     But really, Watson, I am keeping you up, and I might just as well
     tell you all this on our way to Aldershot to-morrow."

     "Thank you, you have gone rather too far to stop."

     "It is quite certain that when Mrs. Barclay left the house at
     half-past seven she was on good terms with her husband.  She was
     never, as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she
     was heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel in a friendly
     fashion.  Now, it was equally certain that, immediately on her
     return, she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see
     her husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman will, and finally,
     on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. 
     Therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine
     o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him.  But
     Miss Morrison had been with her during the whole of that hour and a
     half.  It was absolutely certain, therefore, in spite of her denial,
     that she must know something of the matter.

Iteration: 28000
     "We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the
     Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round
     his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from
     the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him.
     His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the
     greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia,
     which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its
     decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. The
     other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia.
     He has broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his
     track. Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man
     himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the
     fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in
     the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.
     Sherlock Holmes?"

     Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.

     "Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!" he cried. "But I didn't quite
     follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts."

     "The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After
     all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is
     the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am
     gathering all the threads into my hands."

     "And the next stage?"

     "Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
     quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on
     the charge of murder. Will you come with us?"

     "I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can't
     say for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon a
     factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great
     hopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will
     come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the
     heels."

     "In the Italian quarter?"

     "No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him.
     If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I'll promise
     to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be
     done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do
     us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and
     it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You'll dine with
     us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time
     for us to start. In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you
     would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send, and
     it is important that it should go at once."

     Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old
     daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at
     last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said
     nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. For my
     own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had
     traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I could
     not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood clearly
     that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon
     the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick.
     No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act,
     and I could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had
     inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow
     the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not
     surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with
     me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his
     favourite weapon.

     A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
     spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was
     directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed
     with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. In the light
     of a street lamp we read "Laburnum Villa" upon the gate-post of one
     of them. The occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was
     dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single
     blurred circle on to the garden path. The wooden fence which
     separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon
     the inner side, and here it was that we crouched.

     "I fear that you'll have a long wait," Holmes whispered. "We may
     thank our stars that it is not raining. I don't think we can even
     venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it's a two to one chance
     that we get something to pay us for our trouble."

     It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes
     had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular
     fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his
     coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as
     swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it
     whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against
     the black shadow of the house. There was a long pause, during which
     we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our
     ears. The window was being opened. The noise ceased, and again there
     was a long silence. The fellow was making his way into the house. We
     saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he
     sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through
     another blind, and then through another.

     "Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,"
     Lestrade whispered.

     But before we could move the man had emerged again. As he came out
     into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried something
     white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round him. The silence
     of the deserted street reassured him. Turning his back upon us he
     laid down his burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a
     sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. The man was so intent
     upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole
     across the grass plot. With the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his
     back, and an instant later Lestrade and I had him by either wrist and
     the handcuffs had been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a
     hideous, sallow face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at
     us, and I knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we
     had secured.

     But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention.
     Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining
     that which the man had brought from the house. It was a bust of
     Napoleon like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been
     broken into similar fragments. Carefully Holmes held each separate
     shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from any other
     shattered piece of plaster. He had just completed his examination
     when the hall lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the
     house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented
     himself.

     "Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?" said Holmes.

     "Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the note
     which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly what you
     told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited developments.
     Well, I'm very glad to see that you have got the rascal. I hope,
     gentlemen, that you will come in and have some refreshment."

     However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so
     within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four
     upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say; but he
     glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my
     hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We
     stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a search of
     his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath
     knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.

     "That's all right," said Lestrade, as we parted. "Hill knows all
     these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You'll find that my
     theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I'm sure I am
     exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in
     which you laid hands upon him. I don't quite understand it all yet."

     "I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations," said Holmes.
     "Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off,
     and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very
     end. If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o'clock
     blame. On the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind God
     Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still
     undestroyed and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by all
     you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love
     which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give
     one thought to it again.

     "'If then your eye goes onto read this line, I know that I shall
     already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more
     likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue
     sealed forever in death. In either case the time for suppression is
     past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I
     swear as I hope for mercy.

     "'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my
     younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me
     a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which
     seemed to imply that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was
     that I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage I was
     convicted of breaking my country's laws, and was sentenced to
     transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
     debt of honor, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money which
     was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it
     before there could be any possibility of its being missed. But the
     most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had reckoned
     upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts
     exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with,
     but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than
     now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a
     felon with thirty-seven other convicts in 'tween-decks of the bark
     Gloria Scott, bound for Australia.

     "'It was the year '55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the
     old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black
     Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less
     suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. The Gloria Scott
     had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
     heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her
     out. She was a five-hundred-ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight
     jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a
     captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly
     a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from
     Falmouth.

     "'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being
     of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and
     frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had
     particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a young
     man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather
     nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a
     swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for
     his extraordinary height. I don't think any of our heads would have
     come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have
     measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many
     sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and
     resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I
     was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still
     when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear,
     and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which
     separated us.

     "'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here
     for?"

     "'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.

     "'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and by God! You'll learn to bless
     my name before you've done with me."

     "'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an
     immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own
     arrest. He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of
     incurably vicious habits, who had, by an ingenious system of fraud,
     obtained huge sums of money from the leading London merchants.

     "'"Ha, ha! You remember my case!" said he proudly.

     "'"Very well, indeed."

     "'"Then maybe you remember something queer about it?"

     "'"What was that, then?"

     "'"I'd had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn't I?"

     "'"So it was said."

     "'"But none was recovered, eh?"

     "'"No."

     "Her father is very rich?"

     "'"I have no idea," said I.

     "'"Well, where d'ye suppose the balance is?" he asked.

     "Without aid it is so. But suppose you had a friend up here who
     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his

     "'"I have no idea," said I.

     "'"Right between my finger and thumb," he cried. "By God! I've got
     more pounds to my name than you've hairs on your head. And if you've
     money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do
     anything. Now, you don't think it likely that a man who could do
     anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking
     hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a Chin
     China coaster. No, sir, such a man will look after himself and will
     look after his chums. You may lay to that! You hold on to him, and
     you may kiss the book that he'll haul you through."

     "'That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant
     nothing; but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in
     with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really
     was a plot to gain command of the vessel. A dozen of the prisoners
     training and plenty of sleep to keep a team fit. I had a word or two
     concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of
     getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my
     convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"

     "Well, what is it?"

     "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."

     "What do you make of it?"

     "It is very bewildering."

     "It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
     distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
     What do you make of that?"

     "And then?"

     "Elementary," said he.  "It is one of those instances where the
     reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
     neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little point which is
     the basis of the deduction.  The same may be said, my dear fellow,
     for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted
     to the reader.  Now, at present I am in the position of these same
     readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the
     strangest cases which ever perplexed a man's brain, and yet I lack
     the one or two which are needful to complete my theory.  But I'll
     have them, Watson, I'll have them!"  His eyes kindled and a slight
     flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant the veil had lifted
     upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. When I
     glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which
     had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.

     "The problem presents features of interest," said he.  "I may even
     say exceptional features of interest.  I have already looked into the
     matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution.  If
     you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable
     service to me."

     "I should be delighted."

     "Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?"

     "I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice."

     "Very good.  I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo."

     "That would give me time."

     "Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what
     has happened, and of what remains to be done."

     "I was sleepy before you came.  I am quite wakeful now."

     "I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting
     anything vital to the case.  It is conceivable that you may even have
     read some account of the matter.  It is the supposed murder of
     Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am
     investigating."

     "I have heard nothing of it."

     "It has not excited much attention yet, except locally.  The facts
     are only two days old.  Briefly they are these:

     "The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish
     regiments in the British army.  It did wonders both in the Crimea and
     the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every
     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James
     Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
     to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
     so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a
     musket.

     "Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and
     his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
     a former color-sergeant in the same corps.  There was, therefore, as
     can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple
     (for they were still young) found themselves in their new
     surroundings.  They appear, however, to have quickly adapted
     themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
     popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his
     brother officers.  I may add that she was a woman of great beauty,
     and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty
     years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy
     one.  Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that
     he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.  On the
     whole, he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than
     his wife's to Barclay.  He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from
     her for a day.  She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful,
     was less obtrusively affectionate.  But they were regarded in the
     regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.  There was
     absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for
     the tragedy which was to follow.

     "Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in
     his character.  He was a dashing, jovial old solder in his usual
     mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself
     capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness.  This side of
     his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his
     wife.  Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and three out of
     five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular
     sort of depression which came upon him at times.  As the major
     expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if
     by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gaieties and
     chaff of the mess-table.  For days on end, when the mood was on him,
     he has been sunk in the deepest gloom.  This and a certain tinge of
     superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his
     brother officers had observed.  The latter peculiarity took the form
     of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark.  This
     puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often
     given rise to comment and conjecture.

     "The first battalion of the Royal Munsters (which is the old 117th)
     has been stationed at Aldershot for some years.  The married officers
     live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time
     occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the north
     camp.  The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it
     is not more than thirty yards from the high-road.  A coachman and two
     maids form the staff of servants.  These with their master and
     mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no
     children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.

     "Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of
     last Monday.

     "Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church,
     and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the
     Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt
     Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off
     clothing.  A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at
     eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be
     present at it.  When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman
     to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him
     that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss
     Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went
     off together to their meeting.  It lasted forty minutes, and at a
     quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss
     Morrison at her door as she passed.

     "There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine.  This
     faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the
     lawn.  The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the
     highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it.  It was into this
     room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return.  The blinds were not
     down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay
     herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the
     house-maid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to
     her usual habits.  The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room,
     but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the
     morning-room.  The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it.  He
     was never seen again alive.

     "The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten
     minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to
     hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. 
     She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle,
     but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.  Naturally
     enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the
     coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was
     still raging.  They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard,
     those of Barclay and of his wife.  Barclay's remarks were subdued and
     abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners.  The
     lady's, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her
     voice could be plainly heard.  'You coward!' she repeated over and
     over again.  'What can be done now?  What can be done now?  Give me
     back my life.  I will never so much as breathe the same air with you
     again!  You coward!  You Coward!'  Those were scraps of her
     conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man's voice,
     with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman.  Convinced that
     some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove
     to force it, while scream after scream issued from within.  He was
     unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too
     distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him.  A sudden
     thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and
     round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open.  One side
     of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the
     summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room.  His
     mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a
     couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-chair, and
     his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the
     unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.

     "Naturally, the coachman's first thought, on finding that he could do
     nothing for his master, was to open the door.  But here an unexpected
     and singular difficulty presented itself.  The key was not in the
     inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. 
     He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained
     the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned.  The lady,
     against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to
     her room, still in a state of insensibility.  The Colonel's body was
     then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the
     scene of the tragedy.

     "The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was
     found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his
     head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt
     weapon.  Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have
     been.  Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club
     of hard carved wood with a bone handle.  The Colonel possessed a
     varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in

                        THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN

     I had intended "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange" to be the last of
     those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever
     communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any
     lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to
     which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest
     on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique
     methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance
     which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his
     experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the
     records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but
     since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to
     study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become
     hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in
     this matter should be strictly observed. It was only upon my
     representing to him that I had given a promise that "The Adventure of
     the Second Stain" should be published when the times were ripe, and
     pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series
     of episodes should culminate in the most important international case
     which he has ever been called upon to handle, that I at last
     succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully-guarded account
     of the incident should at last be laid before the public. If in
     telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the
     public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for
     my reticence.

     It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be
     nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two
     visitors of European fame within the walls of our humble room in
     Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant,
     was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of
     Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of
     middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was
     the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs,
     and the most rising statesman in the country. They sat side by side
     upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their
     worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing
     importance which had brought them. The Premier's thin, blue-veined
     hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and
     his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The
     European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted
     with the seals of his watch-chain.

     "When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o'clock
     this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his
     suggestion that we have both come to you."

     "Have you informed the police?"

     "No, sir," said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner
     for which he was famous. "We have not done so, nor is it possible
     that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run,
     mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to
     avoid."

     "And why, sir?"

     "Because the document in question is of such immense importance that
     its publication might very easily--I might almost say probably--lead
     to European complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to
     say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery
     can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be
     recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it
     is that its contents should be generally known."

     "I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if
     you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document
     disappeared."

     "That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it
     was a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. It
     was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I
     have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace,
     and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last
     night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was
     dressing for dinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it was
     gone. The despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my
     dressing-table all night. I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. We
     are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room
     during the night. And yet I repeat that the paper is gone."

     "What time did you dine?"

     "Half-past seven."

     "How long was it before you went to bed?"

     "My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was
     half-past eleven before we went to our room."

     "Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?"

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     My blood ran cold in my veins, for there was a break in his voice

     interest."

     "How long was it before you went to bed?"

     "My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was
     half-past eleven before we went to our room."

     "Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?"

     "No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in
     the morning, and my valet, or my wife's maid, during the rest of the
     day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some
     time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there
     was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in
     my despatch-box."

     "Who did know of the existence of that letter?"

     "No one in the house."

     "Surely your wife knew?"

     "No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this
     morning."

     The Premier nodded approvingly.

     "I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty," said
     he. "I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance
     it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties."

     The European Secretary bowed.

     "You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never
     breathed one word to my wife upon this matter."

     "Could she have guessed?"

     "No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed--nor could anyone have
     guessed."

     "Have you lost any documents before?"

     "No, sir."

     "Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this
     letter?"

     "Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the
     pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased
     by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good
     heavens, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost
     it!" His handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his
     hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the
     natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the
     aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned.
     "Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three,
     departmental officials who know of the letter. No one else in
     England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you."

     "But abroad?"

     "I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it.
     I am well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official
     channels have not been employed."

     Holmes considered for some little time.

     "Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is,
     and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?"

     The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier's shaggy
     eyebrows gathered in a frown.

     "Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour.
     There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is
     addressed in large, bold handwriting to--"

     "I fear, sir," said Holmes, "that, interesting and indeed essential
     as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of
     things. What was the letter?"

     "That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I
     cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of
     the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an
     envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved
     well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our
     power to bestow."

     Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.

     "You are two of the most busy men in the country," said he, "and in
     my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret
     exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any
     continuation of this interview would be a waste of time."

     The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his
     deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. "I am not
     accustomed, sir--" he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his
     seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old
     statesman shrugged his shoulders.

     "We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and
     it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our
     entire confidence."

     "I agree with you, sir," said the younger statesman.

     "Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of
     your colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for
     I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that
     this affair should come out."

     "You may safely trust us."

     "The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been
     ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It has
     been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.
     Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter.
     At the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and
     certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its
     publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of
     feeling in this country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I
     do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that
     letter this country would be involved in a great war."

     Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the
     Premier.

     "Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter--this letter which may
     well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a
     hundred thousand men--which has become lost in this unaccountable
     fashion."

     "Have you informed the sender?"

     "Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched."

     "Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter."

     "No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already
     understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner.
     It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if
     this letter were to come out."

     "If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out?
     Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?"

     "There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international
     politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no
     difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed
     camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military
     power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into
     war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other
     confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?"

     "Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this
     potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach
     between his country and ours?"

     "Yes, sir."

     "And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of
     an enemy?"

     "To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding
     on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take
     it."

     Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud.
     The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.

     "It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
     is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are
     in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?"

     Holmes shook his head mournfully.

     "You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be
     war?"

     "I think it is very probable."

     "Then, sir, prepare for war."

     "That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes."

     "Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after
     eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife
     were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It
     was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and
     eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it
     evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as
     early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were
     taken at that hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to
     retain it. It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What
     chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our
     reach."

     The Prime Minister rose from the settee.

     "What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the
     matter is indeed out of our hands."

     "Let us presume, for argument's sake, that the document was taken by
     the maid or by the valet--"

     "They are both old and tried servants."

     "I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that
     there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could
     go up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has
     taken it. To whom would the thief take it? To one of several
     international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably
     familiar to me. There are three who may be said to be the heads of
     their profession. I will begin my research by going round and finding
     if each of them is at his post. If one is missing--especially if he
     has disappeared since last night--we will have some indication as to
     where the document has gone."

     "Why should he be missing?" asked the European Secretary. "He would
     take the letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not."

     "I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations
     with the Embassies are often strained."

     The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.

     "I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a
     prize to head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course
     of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all
     our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be
     any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you,
     and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries."

     The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.

     When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in
     silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had
     opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime
     which had occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an
     exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the
     mantelpiece.

     "Yes," said he, "there is no better way of approaching it. The
     situation is desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be
     sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not
     yet passed out of his hands. After all, it is a question of money
     with these fellows, and I have the British Treasury behind me. If
     it's on the market I'll buy it--if it means another penny on the
     income-tax. It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to
     see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the
     other. There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game;
     there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. I will see each
     of them."

     I glanced at my morning paper.

     "Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?"

     "Yes."

     "You will not see him."

     "Why not?"

     "He was murdered in his house last night."

     My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures
     that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely
     I had astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the
     paper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged
     in reading when he rose from his chair:

                              Murder in Westminster
     A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16,
     Godolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of
     eighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey,
     almost in the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament.
     This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by
     Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of
     his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved
     reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country.
     Mr. Lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his
     establishment consists of Mrs. Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and
     of Mitton, his valet. The former retires early and sleeps at the top
     of the house. The valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at
     Hammersmith. From ten o'clock onwards Mr. Lucas had the house to
     himself. What occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but
     at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett, passing along
     Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No. 16 was ajar. He
     knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the front room
     he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without reply. He
     then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in a state of
     wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one
     chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still
     grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He
     had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife
     with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger,
     plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the
     walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime,
     for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the
     room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his
     violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense
     sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.

     "Well, Watson, what do you make of this?" asked Holmes, after a long
     pause.

     "It is an amazing coincidence."

     "A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as
     possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during
     the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The
     odds are enormous against its being coincidence. No figures could
     express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected--must
     be connected. It is for us to find the connection."

     "But now the official police must know all."

     "Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They
     know--and shall know--nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only we know of
     both events, and can trace the relation between them. There is one
     obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions
     against Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes'
     walk from Whitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have
     named live in the extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore, for
     Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a
     message from the European Secretary's household--a small thing, and
     yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove
     essential. Halloa! what have we here?"

     Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes
     glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.

     "Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step
     up," said he.

     A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that
     morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely
     woman in London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest
     daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no
     contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the
     subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite
     head. And yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty
     which would be the first thing to impress the observer. The cheek was
     lovely, but it was paled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it
     was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn
     in an effort after self-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang
     first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in
     the open door.

     "Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Yes, madam, he has been here."

     "Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here." Holmes
     bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.

     "Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you
     will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot
     make any unconditional promise."

     She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the
     window. It was a queenly presence--tall, graceful, and intensely
     womanly.

     "Mr. Holmes," she said, and her white-gloved hands clasped and
     unclasped as she spoke--"I will speak frankly to you in the hope that
     it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete
     confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That
     one is politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing.
     Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our
     house last night. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because
     the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his
     complete confidence. Now it is essential--essential, I say--that I
     should thoroughly understand it. You are the only other person, save
     only these politicians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then,
     Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will
     lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client's
     interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he
     would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his
     complete confidence. What was this paper which was stolen?"

     "Madam, what you ask me is really impossible."

     She groaned and sank her face in her hands.

     "You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to
     keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only
     learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to
     tell what he has withheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom
     you must ask."

     "I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your
     telling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service
     if you would enlighten me on one point."

     "What is it, madam?"

     "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this

Iteration: 30000
     "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"

     "I do not know what to believe."

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

     "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     admit that the footmark is material."

     "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out,
     and yet he was diabolical as well."

     "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But
     now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have
     you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it
     is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me
     to do it."

     "I did not say that I desired you to do it."

     "Then, how can I assist you?"

     "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville,
     who arrives at Waterloo Station"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his
     watch--"in exactly one hour and a quarter."

     "He being the heir?"

     "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
     gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the
     accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
     way. I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of
     Sir Charles's will."

     "There is no other claimant, I presume?"

     "None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was
     Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir
     Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the
     father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of
     the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was
     the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He
     made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died
     there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
     In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have
     had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr.
     Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"

     "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"

     "It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
     Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that
     if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would
     have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and
     the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be
     denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side
     depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by
     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
     Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious
     interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you
     and ask for your advice."

     Holmes considered for a little time.

     "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your opinion
     there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for
     a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"

     "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
     that this may be so."

     "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
     could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A
     devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too
     inconceivable a thing."

     "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would
     probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
     things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man
     will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty
     minutes. What would you recommend?"

     "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
     scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir
     Henry Baskerville."

     "And then?"

     "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my
     mind about the matter."

     "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"

     "Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
     much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of
     help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry
     Baskerville with you."

     "I will do so, Mr. Holmes." He scribbled the appointment on his
     shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
     fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

     "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir
     Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon
     the moor?"

     "Three people did."

     "Did any see it after?"

     "I have not heard of any."

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
     satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

     "Going out, Watson?"

     "Unless I can help you."

     "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you
     for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of
     view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound
     could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should
     be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting
     problem which has been submitted to us this morning."

     I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
     in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he
     weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories,
     balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which
     points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day
     at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was
     nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once
     more.

     My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken
     out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp
     upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears
     were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco
     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I
     had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an
     armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of
     paper lay around him.

     "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.

     "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."

     "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."

     "Thick! It is intolerable."

     "Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
     perceive."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "Am I right?"

     "Certainly, but how?"

     He laughed at my bewildered expression.

     "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a
     pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your
     expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
     immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
     boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with
     intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
     obvious?"

     "Well, it is rather obvious."

     "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
     observes. Where do you think that I have been?"

     "A fixture also."

     "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."

     "In spirit?"

     "Exactly. My body has remained in this arm-chair and has, I regret to
     observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
     incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
     Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my
     spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could
     find my way about."

     "A large scale map, I presume?"

     "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
     "Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is
     Baskerville Hall in the middle."

     "With a wood round it?"

     "Exactly. I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name,
     must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon
     the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of
     Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a
     radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered
     dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative.
     There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
     naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are
     two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles
     away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these
     scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is
     the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may
     help to play it again."

     "It must be a wild place."

     "Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
     hand in the affairs of men--"

     "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."

     "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There
     are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether
     any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime
     and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should
     be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws
     of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to
     exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I
     think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. It is a
     singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a
     concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of
     getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my
     convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"

     "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."

     "What do you make of it?"

     "It is very bewildering."

     "It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
     distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
     What do you make of that?"

     "Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
     the alley."

     "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should
     a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"

     "What then?"

     "He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,
     running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face."

     "Running from what?"

     "There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was
     crazed with fear before ever he began to run."

     "How can you say that?"

     "I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the
     moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had
     lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If
     the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help
     in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom
     was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the
     Yew Alley rather than in his own house?"

     "You think that he was waiting for someone?"

     "The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an
     evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is
     it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr.
     Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him
     credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"

     "But he went out every evening."

     "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening.
     On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night
     he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for
     London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I
     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."





          CHAPTER IV
          Sir Henry Baskerville


     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious
     face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten
     appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
     yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of
     his bearing which indicated the gentleman.

     "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.

     "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
     that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this
     morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you
     think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants
     more thinking out than I am able to give it."

     "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
     have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
     London?"

     "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
     It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me
     this morning."

     He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was
     of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir Henry
     Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters;
     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     evening.

     "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked
     Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

     "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     "No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor. "There was
     no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel."

     "Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements."
     Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded
     into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the
     middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of
     pasting printed words upon it. It ran:

     As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

     The word "moor" only was printed in ink.

     "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
     Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that
     takes so much interest in my affairs?"

     "What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
     nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"

     "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
     that the business is supernatural."

     "What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply. "It seems to me that all
     you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."

     "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
     I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will confine ourselves
     for the present with your permission to this very interesting
     document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday
     evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"

     "It is here in the corner."

     "Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the
     leading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up
     and down the columns. "Capital article this on free trade. Permit me
     to give you an extract from it.

     "'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or
     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it
     stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
     wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower
     the general conditions of life in this island.'

     "What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee,
     rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think that
     is an admirable sentiment?"

     Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest,
     and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

     "I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind," said
     he; "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that
     note is concerned."

     "On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
     Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I
     fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this
     sentence."

     "No, I confess that I see no connection."

     "And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that
     the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,'
     'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence
     these words have been taken?"

     "By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!" cried Sir
     Henry.

     "If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep
     away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece."

     "Well, now--so it is!"

     "Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have
     imagined," said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. "I
     could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper;
     but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading
     article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have
     ever known. How did you do it?"

     "I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from
     that of an Esquimau?"

     "Most certainly."

     "But how?"

     "Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The
     supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--"

     "But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally
     obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded
     bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an
     evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and
     your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the most elementary
     branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I
     confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury
     with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely
     distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else.
     As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should
     find the words in yesterday's issue."

     "So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes," said Sir Henry
     Baskerville, "someone cut out this message with a scissors--"

     "Nail-scissors," said Holmes. "You can see that it was a very
     short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over
     'keep away.'"

     "That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
     short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--"

     "Gum," said Holmes.

     "With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'
     should have been written?"

     "Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all
     simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less
     common."

     "Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else
     in this message, Mr. Holmes?"

     "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
     taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in
     rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in
     any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it,
     therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished
     to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own
     writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be
     known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed
     on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others.
     'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point
     to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part
     of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the
     matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer
     of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up
     the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any
     letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
     would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption--and
     from whom?"

     "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr.
     Mortimer.

     "Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and
     choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination,
     but we have always some material basis on which to start our
     speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am
     almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."

     "How in the world can you say that?"

     "If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the
     ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a
     single word, and has run dry three times in a short address, showing
     that there was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or
     ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the
     combination of the two must be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink

     "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"

     "I do not know what to believe."

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

     "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     admit that the footmark is material."

     "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out,
     and yet he was diabolical as well."

     "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But
     now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have
     you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it
     is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me
     to do it."

     "I did not say that I desired you to do it."

     "Then, how can I assist you?"

     "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville,
     who arrives at Waterloo Station"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his
     watch--"in exactly one hour and a quarter."

     "He being the heir?"

     "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
     gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the
     accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
     way. I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of
     Sir Charles's will."

     "There is no other claimant, I presume?"

     "None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was
     Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir
     Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the
     father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of
     the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was
     the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He
     made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died
     there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
     In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have
     had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr.
     Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"

     "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"

     "It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
     Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that
     if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would
     have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and
     the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be
     denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side
     depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by
     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
     Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious
     interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you
     and ask for your advice."

     Holmes considered for a little time.

     "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your opinion
     there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for
     a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"

     "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
     that this may be so."

     "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
     could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A
     devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too
     inconceivable a thing."

     "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would
     probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
     things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man
     will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty
     minutes. What would you recommend?"

     "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
     scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir
     Henry Baskerville."

     "And then?"

     "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my
     mind about the matter."

     "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"

     "Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
     much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of
     help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry
     Baskerville with you."

     "I will do so, Mr. Holmes." He scribbled the appointment on his
     shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
     fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

     "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir
     Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon
     the moor?"

     "Three people did."

     "Did any see it after?"

     "I have not heard of any."

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
     satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

     "Going out, Watson?"

     "Unless I can help you."

     "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you
     for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of
     view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound
     of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you
     could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should
     be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting
     problem which has been submitted to us this morning."

     I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
     in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he
     weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories,
     balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which
     points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day
     at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was
     nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once
     more.

     My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken
     out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp
     upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears
     were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco
     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I
     had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an
     armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of
     paper lay around him.

     "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.

     "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."

     "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."

     "Thick! It is intolerable."

     "Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
     perceive."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "Am I right?"

     "Certainly, but how?"

     He laughed at my bewildered expression.

     "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a
     pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your
     expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
     immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
     boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with
     intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
     obvious?"

     "Well, it is rather obvious."

     "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
     observes. Where do you think that I have been?"

     "A fixture also."

     "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."

     "In spirit?"

     "Exactly. My body has remained in this arm-chair and has, I regret to
     observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
     incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
     Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my
     spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could
     find my way about."

     "A large scale map, I presume?"

     "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
     "Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is
     Baskerville Hall in the middle."

     "With a wood round it?"

     "Exactly. I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name,
     must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon
     the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of
     Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a
     radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered
     dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative.
     There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
     naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are
     two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles
     away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these
     scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is
     the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may
     help to play it again."

     "It must be a wild place."

     "Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
     hand in the affairs of men--"

     "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."

     "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There
     are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether
     any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime
     and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should
     be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws
     of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to
     exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I
     think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. It is a
     singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a
     concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of
     getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my
     convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"

     "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."

     "What do you make of it?"

     "It is very bewildering."

     "It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
     distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
     What do you make of that?"

     "Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
     the alley."

     "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should
     a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"

     "What then?"

     "He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,
     running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face."

     "Running from what?"

     "There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was
     crazed with fear before ever he began to run."

     "How can you say that?"

     "I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the
     moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had
     lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If
     the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help
     in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom
     was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the
     Yew Alley rather than in his own house?"

     "You think that he was waiting for someone?"

     "The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an
     evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is
     it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr.
     Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him
     credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"

     "But he went out every evening."

     "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening.
     On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night
     he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for
     London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I
     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."





          CHAPTER IV
          Sir Henry Baskerville


     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious
     face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten
     appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
     yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of
     his bearing which indicated the gentleman.

     "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.

     "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
     that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this
     morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you
     think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants
     more thinking out than I am able to give it."

     "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
     have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
     London?"

     "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
     It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me
     this morning."

     He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was
     of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir Henry
     Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters;
     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     evening.

     "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked
     Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

     "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     "No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor. "There was
     no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel."

     "Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements."
     Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded
     into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the
     middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of
     pasting printed words upon it. It ran:

     As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

     The word "moor" only was printed in ink.

     "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
     Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that
     takes so much interest in my affairs?"

     "What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
     nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"

     "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
     that the business is supernatural."

     "What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply. "It seems to me that all
     you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."

     "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
     I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will confine ourselves
     for the present with your permission to this very interesting
     document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday
     evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"

     "It is here in the corner."

     "Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the
     leading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up
     and down the columns. "Capital article this on free trade. Permit me
     to give you an extract from it.

     "'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or
     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it
     stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
     wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower
     the general conditions of life in this island.'

     "What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee,
     rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think that
     is an admirable sentiment?"

     Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest,
     and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

     "I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind," said
     he; "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that
     note is concerned."

     "On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
     Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I
     fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this
     sentence."

     "No, I confess that I see no connection."

     "And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that
     the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,'
     'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence
     these words have been taken?"

     "By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!" cried Sir
     Henry.

     "If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep
     away' and 'from the' are cut out in one piece."

     "Well, now--so it is!"

     "Really, Mr. Holmes, this exceeds anything which I could have
     imagined," said Dr. Mortimer, gazing at my friend in amazement. "I
     could understand anyone saying that the words were from a newspaper;
     but that you should name which, and add that it came from the leading
     article, is really one of the most remarkable things which I have
     ever known. How did you do it?"

     "I presume, Doctor, that you could tell the skull of a negro from
     that of an Esquimau?"

     "Most certainly."

     "But how?"

     "Because that is my special hobby. The differences are obvious. The
     supra-orbital crest, the facial angle, the maxillary curve, the--"

     "But this is my special hobby, and the differences are equally
     obvious. There is as much difference to my eyes between the leaded
     bourgeois type of a Times article and the slovenly print of an
     evening half-penny paper as there could be between your negro and
     your Esquimau. The detection of types is one of the most elementary
     branches of knowledge to the special expert in crime, though I
     confess that once when I was very young I confused the Leeds Mercury
     with the Western Morning News. But a Times leader is entirely
     distinctive, and these words could have been taken from nothing else.
     As it was done yesterday the strong probability was that we should
     find the words in yesterday's issue."

     "So far as I can follow you, then, Mr. Holmes," said Sir Henry
     Baskerville, "someone cut out this message with a scissors--"

     "Nail-scissors," said Holmes. "You can see that it was a very
     short-bladed scissors, since the cutter had to take two snips over
     'keep away.'"

     "That is so. Someone, then, cut out the message with a pair of
     short-bladed scissors, pasted it with paste--"

     "Gum," said Holmes.

     "With gum on to the paper. But I want to know why the word 'moor'
     should have been written?"

     "Because he could not find it in print. The other words were all
     simple and might be found in any issue, but 'moor' would be less
     common."

     "Why, of course, that would explain it. Have you read anything else
     in this message, Mr. Holmes?"

     "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
     taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in
     rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in
     any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it,
     therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished
     to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own
     writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be
     known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed
     on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others.
     'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point
     to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part
     of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the
     matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer
     of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up
     the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any
     letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
     would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption--and
     from whom?"

     "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr.
     Mortimer.

     "Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and
     choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination,
     but we have always some material basis on which to start our
     speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am
     almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."

     "How in the world can you say that?"

     "If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the
     ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a
     single word, and has run dry three times in a short address, showing
     that there was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or
     ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the

     "Pile it on, men, pile it on!" cried Holmes, looking down into the
     engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,
     aquiline face. "Get every pound of steam you can."

     "I think we gain a little," said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.

     "I am sure of it," said I. "We shall be up with her in a very few
     minutes."

     At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with
     three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting
     our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could
     round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two
     hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky
     uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our
     boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated
     and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had
     shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long
     Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The
     dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the
     dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we
     could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the
     stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped.
     Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The
     boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I
     could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for
     dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we
     were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and
     turning which they took there could no longer be any question about
     it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At
     Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I
     have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered
     career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad,
     flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard
     by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and
     clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon
     the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while
     every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the
     distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones
     yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat's lengths
     behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear
     reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the
     melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in
     the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at
     us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,
     powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I
     could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump
     upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there
     was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened
     itself into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a
     great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.
     Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the
     sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort
     of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that
     face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen
     features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small
     eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were
     writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a
     half animal fury.

     "Fire if he raises his hand," said Holmes, quietly. We were within a
     boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I
     can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his
     legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with
     his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the
     light of our lantern.

     It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he
     plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood,
     like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out
     together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of
     choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of
     his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At
     the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder
     and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the
     southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a
     few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already
     nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon
     glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant
     water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud
     ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush
     with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank
     its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and
     writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or
     backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into
     the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden
     pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch
     alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the
     end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out,
     and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths,
     father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly
     enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast
     to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the
     deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had
     contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key,
     but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to
     our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we
     flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of
     the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames
     lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.

     "See here," said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. "We were
     hardly quick enough with our pistols." There, sure enough, just
     behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts
     which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant
     that we fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his
     easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the
     horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.





          CHAPTER XI
          The Great Agra Treasure


     Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had
     done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned,
     reckless-eyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over
     his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was
     a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who
     was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been
     fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with
     gray. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy
     brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible
     expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands
     upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with
     his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his
     ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in
     his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a
     gleam of something like humour in his eyes.

     "Well, Jonathan Small," said Holmes, lighting a cigar, "I am sorry
     that it has come to this."

     "And so am I, sir," he answered, frankly. "I don't believe that I can
     swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never
     raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga
     who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir.
     I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the
     little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done,
     and I could not undo it again."

     "Have a cigar," said Holmes; "and you had best take a pull out of my
     flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a
     man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while
     you were climbing the rope?"

     "You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The
     truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of
     the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually
     went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The
     best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had
     been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I
     would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar.
     But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto,
     with whom I had no quarrel whatever."

     "You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He
     is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true
     account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you
     do I hope that I may be of use to you.  I think I can prove that the
     poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached
     the room."

     "That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw
     him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through
     the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I'd have half killed Tonga for
     it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his
     club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say
     helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more
     than I can tell. I don't feel no malice against you for it. But it
     does seem a queer thing," he added, with a bitter smile, "that I who
     have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend
     the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and
     am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an
     evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet
     and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything
     but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder,
     to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery
     for life."

     At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy
     shoulders into the tiny cabin. "Quite a family party," he remarked.
     "I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes.  Well, I think we
     may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive;
     but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut
     it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her."

     "All is well that ends well," said Holmes. "But I certainly did not
     know that the Aurora was such a clipper."

     "Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that
     if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should
     never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood
     business."

     "Neither he did," cried our prisoner,--"not a word. I chose his
     launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but
     we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached
     our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the
     Brazils."

     "Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to
     him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick
     in condemning them." It was amusing to notice how the consequential
     Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of
     the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock
     Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon
     him.

     "We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently," said Jones, "and shall
     land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you
     that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing
     this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an
     agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector
     with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no
     doubt?"

     "Yes, I shall drive."

     "It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first.
     You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?"

     "At the bottom of the river," said Small, shortly.

     "Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have
     had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn
     you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street
     rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station."

     They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,
     genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour's drive
     brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servant seemed surprised at
     so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she
     explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in
     the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving
     the obliging inspector in the cab.

     She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white
     diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and
     waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned
     back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and
     tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant
     hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and
     her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the
     sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright
     flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.

     "I heard a cab drive up," she said. "I thought that Mrs. Forrester
     had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you.
     What news have you brought me?"

     "I have brought something better than news," said I, putting down the
     box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my
     heart was heavy within me. "I have brought you something which is
     worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune."

     She glanced at iron box. "Is that the treasure, then?" she asked,
     coolly enough.

     "Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half
     is Thaddeus Sholto's. You will have a couple of hundred thousand
     each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be
     few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?"

     I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that
     she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her
     eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.

     "If I have it," said she, "I owe it to you."

     "No, no," I answered, "not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
     With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue
     which has taxed even his analytical genius.  As it was, we very
     nearly lost it at the last moment."

     "Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson," said she.

     I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her
     last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora,
     the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and
     the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and
     shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the
     dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I
     feared that she was about to faint.

     "It is nothing," she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.
     "I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed
     my friends in such horrible peril."

     "That is all over," I answered. "It was nothing. I will tell you no
     more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the
     treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it
     with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see
     it."

     "It would be of the greatest interest to me," she said. There was no
     eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that
     it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize
     which had cost so much to win.

     "What a pretty box!" she said, stooping over it. "This is Indian
     work, I suppose?"

     "Yes; it is Benares metal-work."

     "And so heavy!" she exclaimed, trying to raise it. "The box alone
     must be of some value. Where is the key?"

     "Small threw it into the Thames," I answered. "I must borrow Mrs.
     Forrester's poker." There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,
     wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end
     of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open
     with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We
     both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!

     No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch
     thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest
     constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or
     crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and
     completely empty.

     "The treasure is lost," said Miss Morstan, calmly.

     As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great
     shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra
     treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.
     It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize
     nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. "Thank
     God!" I ejaculated from my very heart.

     She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. "Why do you say
     that?" she asked.

     "Because you are within my reach again," I said, taking her hand. She
     did not withdraw it. "Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a
     man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my
     lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is
     why I said, 'Thank God.'"

     "Then I say, 'Thank God,' too," she whispered, as I drew her to my
     side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had
     gained one.





          CHAPTER XII
          The Strange Story of Jonathan Small


     A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary
     time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him
     the empty box.

     "There goes the reward!" said he, gloomily. "Where there is no money
     there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner
     each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there."

     "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man," I said. "He will see that you
     are rewarded, treasure or no."

     The inspector shook his head despondently, however. "It's a bad job,"
     he repeated; "and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think."

     His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank
     enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They
     had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had
     changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon
     the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual
     listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with
     his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty
     attracted attention.  I spent a day in the search, and by
     my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private
     to me a tinge of melancholy lay upon the country-side, which bore so

     the different steps in my reasoning. To begin at the beginning. I
     shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the

     "Quite so. And she was afterwards seen walking into Hyde Park in

     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James

     epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died. It never
     comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their
     whereabouts.

     "A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will
     understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do."

     "What explanation did she give of having answered the bell when Mr.
     reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
     broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had
     natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the
     aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned.
     "Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three,
     present."

     "Carried off from where?"

     "Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle
     Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

     "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."

     "Yes."

     "To see Mrs. Laura Lyons?"



          CHAPTER XII
          The Strange Story of Jonathan Small

     Our opponent opened the door.

     "There are one or two indications, and yet the utmost pains have been
     taken to remove all clues. The address, you observe is printed in
     rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in
     any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it,
     therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished
     to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own
     writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be
     known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed
     on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others.
     'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point
     to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part
     of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the
     matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer
     of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up
     the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any
     letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
     would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption--and
     from whom?"

     "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr.
     Mortimer.

     "But not more so than I to find you."

     "Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover," he answered,
     with a shrewd, sidelong look. "The man that was clever enough to hunt
     me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a
     river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a
     harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when
     you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I've
     had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry
     over spilled milk."

     "This is a very serious matter, Small," said the detective. "If you
     had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would
     have had a better chance at your trial."

     "Justice!" snarled the ex-convict. "A pretty justice! Whose loot is
     this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it
     up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it!
     Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under
     the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts,
     bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed
     black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That
     was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice
     because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that
     another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have
     one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and
     feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that
     should be mine." Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this
     came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the
     handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his
     hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the
     man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had
     possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict
     was upon his track.

     "You forget that we know nothing of all this," said Holmes quietly.
     upon the table and two upon the mantelpiece. In the corner, stooping
     over a desk, there sat what appeared to be a little girl. Her face
     easy task to know which I should select to lay before the public. I
     should be mine." Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this
     room.

     We had sprung to our feet, and for a few moments we stared in silent
     telling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service
     whispered something to her husband.

     "Now, Watson, now!" cried Holmes, with frenzied eagerness. All the
     demoniacal force of the man masked behind that listless manner burst
     out in a paroxysm of energy. He tore the drugget from the floor, and
     in an instant was down on his hands and knees clawing at each of the
     squares of wood beneath it. One turned sideways as he dug his nails
     into the edge of it. It hinged back like the lid of a box. A small
     black cavity opened beneath it. Holmes plunged his eager hand into
     it, and drew it out with a bitter snarl of anger and disappointment.

Iteration: 33000
     "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "It was a dangerous, reckless
     attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having
     found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to
     be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
     could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was
     much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the
     missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of
     the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it
     into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put
     it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an
     effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that
     they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise
     they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was
     about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by
     the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and
     so changed the conversation."

     "Good heavens!" cried the Colonel, laughing, "do you mean to say all
     our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?"

     "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," cried I, looking in
     amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new
     phase of his astuteness.

     "It is an art which is often useful," said he. "When I recovered I
     managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of
     ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that
     I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper."

     "Oh, what an ass I have been!" I exclaimed.

     "I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,"
     said Holmes, laughing. "I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
     which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and
     having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind
     the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their
     attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I
     had hardly got the paper, however--which was, as I had expected, in
     one of them--when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
     believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and
     friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat
     now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get
     the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you
     see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair
     made them perfectly desperate.

     "I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive
     of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
     demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could
     have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against
     him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of
     everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two
     masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr. Acton's, and
     having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of
     exposure, to levy black-mail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a
     dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of
     positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was
     convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid
     of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had
     they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention
     to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion
     might never have been aroused."

     "And the note?" I asked.

     Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.

     [ Picture: Paper which reads: If you will only come around at quarter
     to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much
     surprise you and may be of the greatest service to you and also to
     Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone upon the matter ]

     "It is very much the sort of thing that I expected," said he. "Of
     course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between
     Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The results
     shows that the trap was skillfully baited. I am sure that you cannot
     fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p's and
     in the tails of the g's. The absence of the i-dots in the old man's
     writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest
     in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly
     return much invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow." 






                                 THE CROOKED MAN

     One summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my
     own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day's
     work had been an exhausting one.  My wife had already gone upstairs,
     and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told
     me that the servants had also retired.  I had risen from my seat and
     was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang
     of the bell.

     I looked at the clock.  It was a quarter to twelve.  This could not
     be a visitor at so late an hour.  A patient, evidently, and possibly
     an all-night sitting.  With a wry face I went out into the hall and
     opened the door.  To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood
     upon my step.

     "Ah, Watson," said he, "I hoped that I might not be too late to catch
     you."

     "My dear fellow, pray come in."

     "You look surprised, and no wonder!  Relieved, too, I fancy!  Hum! 
     You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then! 
     There's no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat.  It's easy to
     tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson.  You'll
     never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of
     carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve.  Could you put me up
     tonight?"

     "With pleasure."

     "You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that
     you have no gentleman visitor at present.  Your hat-stand proclaims
     as much."

     "I shall be delighted if you will stay."

     "Thank you.  I'll fill the vacant peg then.  Sorry to see that you've
     had the British workman in the house.  He's a token of evil.  Not the
     drains, I hope?"

     "No, the gas."

     "Ah!  He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum
     just where the light strikes it.  No, thank you, I had some supper at
     Waterloo, but I'll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure."

     I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and
     smoked for some time in silence.  I was well aware that nothing but
     business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour,
     so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.

     "I see that you are professionally rather busy just now," said he,
     glancing very keenly across at me.

     "Yes, I've had a busy day," I answered.  "It may seem very foolish in
     your eyes," I added, "but really I don't know how you deduced it."

     Holmes chuckled to himself.

     "I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson," said
     he.  "When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long
     one you use a hansom.  As I perceive that your boots, although used,
     are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy
     enough to justify the hansom."

     "Excellent!" I cried.

     "Elementary," said he.  "It is one of those instances where the
     reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
     neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little point which is
     the basis of the deduction.  The same may be said, my dear fellow,
     for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted
     to the reader.  Now, at present I am in the position of these same
     readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the
     strangest cases which ever perplexed a man's brain, and yet I lack
     the one or two which are needful to complete my theory.  But I'll
     have them, Watson, I'll have them!"  His eyes kindled and a slight
     flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant the veil had lifted
     upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. When I
     glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which
     had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.

     "The problem presents features of interest," said he.  "I may even
     say exceptional features of interest.  I have already looked into the
     matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution.  If
     you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable
     service to me."

     "I should be delighted."

     "Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?"

     "I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice."

     "Very good.  I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo."

     "That would give me time."

     "Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what
     has happened, and of what remains to be done."

     "I was sleepy before you came.  I am quite wakeful now."

     "I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting
     anything vital to the case.  It is conceivable that you may even have
     read some account of the matter.  It is the supposed murder of
     Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am
     investigating."

     "I have heard nothing of it."

     "It has not excited much attention yet, except locally.  The facts
     are only two days old.  Briefly they are these:

     "The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish
     regiments in the British army.  It did wonders both in the Crimea and
     the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every
     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James
     Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
     to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
     so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a
     musket.

     "Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and
     his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
     a former color-sergeant in the same corps.  There was, therefore, as
     can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple
     (for they were still young) found themselves in their new
     surroundings.  They appear, however, to have quickly adapted
     themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
     popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his
     brother officers.  I may add that she was a woman of great beauty,
     and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty
     years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy
     one.  Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that
     he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.  On the
     whole, he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than
     his wife's to Barclay.  He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from
     her for a day.  She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful,
     was less obtrusively affectionate.  But they were regarded in the
     regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.  There was
     absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for
     the tragedy which was to follow.

     "Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in
     his character.  He was a dashing, jovial old solder in his usual
     mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself
     capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness.  This side of
     his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his
     wife.  Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and three out of
     five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular
     sort of depression which came upon him at times.  As the major
     expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if
     by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gaieties and
     chaff of the mess-table.  For days on end, when the mood was on him,
     he has been sunk in the deepest gloom.  This and a certain tinge of
     superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his
     brother officers had observed.  The latter peculiarity took the form
     of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark.  This
     puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often
     given rise to comment and conjecture.

     "The first battalion of the Royal Munsters (which is the old 117th)
     has been stationed at Aldershot for some years.  The married officers
     live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time
     occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the north
     camp.  The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it
     is not more than thirty yards from the high-road.  A coachman and two
     maids form the staff of servants.  These with their master and
     mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no
     children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.

     "Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of
     last Monday.

     "Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church,
     and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the
     Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt
     Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off
     clothing.  A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at
     eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be
     present at it.  When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman
     to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him
     that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss
     Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went
     off together to their meeting.  It lasted forty minutes, and at a
     quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss
     Morrison at her door as she passed.

     "There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine.  This
     faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the
     lawn.  The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the
     highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it.  It was into this
     room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return.  The blinds were not
     down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay
     herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the
     house-maid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to
     her usual habits.  The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room,
     but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the
     morning-room.  The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it.  He
     was never seen again alive.

     "The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten
     minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to
     hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. 
     She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle,
     but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.  Naturally
     enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the
     coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was
     still raging.  They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard,
     those of Barclay and of his wife.  Barclay's remarks were subdued and
     abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners.  The
     lady's, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her
     voice could be plainly heard.  'You coward!' she repeated over and
     over again.  'What can be done now?  What can be done now?  Give me
     back my life.  I will never so much as breathe the same air with you
     again!  You coward!  You Coward!'  Those were scraps of her
     conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man's voice,
     with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman.  Convinced that
     some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove
     to force it, while scream after scream issued from within.  He was
     unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too
     distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him.  A sudden
     thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and
     round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open.  One side
     of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the
     summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room.  His
     mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a
     couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-chair, and
     his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the
     unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.

     "Naturally, the coachman's first thought, on finding that he could do
     nothing for his master, was to open the door.  But here an unexpected
     and singular difficulty presented itself.  The key was not in the
     inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. 
     He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained
     the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned.  The lady,
     against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to
     her room, still in a state of insensibility.  The Colonel's body was
     then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the
     scene of the tragedy.

     "The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was
     found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his
     head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt
     weapon.  Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have
     been.  Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club
     of hard carved wood with a bone handle.  The Colonel possessed a
     varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in
     which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that his
     club was among his trophies.  The servants deny having seen it
     before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is
     possible that it may have been overlooked.  Nothing else of
     importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the
     inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay's person nor upon
     that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to
     be found.  The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from
     Aldershot.

     "That was the state of things, Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning
     I, at the request of Major Murphy, went down to Aldershot to
     supplement the efforts of the police.  I think that you will
     acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my
     observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more
     extraordinary than would at first sight appear.

     "Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only
     succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated.  One
     other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the
     housemaid.  You will remember that on hearing the sound of the
     quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants.  On that
     first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her
     master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly
     anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they
     had fallen out.  On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she
     heard the word David uttered twice by the lady.  The point is of the
     utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden
     quarrel.  The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.

     "There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest
     impression both upon the servants and the police.  This was the
     contortion of the Colonel's face.  It had set, according to their
     account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a
     human countenance is capable of assuming.  More than one person
     fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect.  It was
     quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused
     him the utmost horror.  This, of course, fitted in well enough with
     the police theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a
     murderous attack upon him.  Nor was the fact of the wound being on
     the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have
     turned to avoid the blow.  No information could be got from the lady
     herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of
     brain-fever.

     "From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember went
     out that evening with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge of
     what it was which had caused the ill-humor in which her companion had
     returned.

     "Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over
     them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which
     were merely incidental.  There could be no question that the most
     distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular
     disappearance of the door-key.  A most careful search had failed to
     discover it in the room.  Therefore it must have been taken from it. 
     But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel's wife could have taken it. 
     That was perfectly clear.  Therefore a third person must have entered
     the room.  And that third person could only have come in through the
     window.  It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and
     the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious
     individual.  You know my methods, Watson.  There was not one of them
     which I did not apply to the inquiry.  And it ended by my discovering
     traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected. 
     There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming
     from the road.  I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of
     his foot-marks:  one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had
     climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon
     the stained boards near the window where he had entered.  He had
     apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper
     than his heels.  But it was not the man who surprised me.  It was his
     companion."

     "His companion!"

     Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and
     carefully unfolded it upon his knee.

     "What do you make of that?" he asked.

     The paper was covered with the tracings of the foot-marks of some
     small animal.  It had five well-marked foot-pads, an indication of
     long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as  a
     dessert-spoon.

     "It's a dog," said I.

     "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?  I found distinct
     traces that this creature had done so."

     "A monkey, then?"

     "But it is not the print of a monkey."

     "What can it be, then?"

     "Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar
     with.  I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements.  Here
     are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless.  You
     see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. 
     Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not
     much less than two feet long--probably more if there is any tail. 
     But now observe this other measurement.  The animal has been moving,
     and we have the length of its stride.  In each case it is only about
     three inches.  You have an indication, you see, of a long body with
     very short legs attached to it.  It has not been considerate enough
     to leave any of its hair behind it.  But its general shape must be
     what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is
     carnivorous."

     "How do you deduce that?"

     "Because it ran up the curtain.  A canary's cage was hanging in the
     window, and its aim seems to have been to get at the bird."

     "Then what was the beast?"

     "Ah, if I could give it a name it might go a long way towards solving
     the case.  On the whole, it was probably some creature of the weasel
     and stoat tribe--and yet it is larger than any of these that I have
     seen."

     "But what had it to do with the crime?"

     "That, also, is still obscure.  But we have learned a good deal, you
     perceive.  We know that a man stood in the road looking at the
     quarrel between the Barclays--the blinds were up and the room
     lighted.  We know, also, that he ran across the lawn, entered the
     room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the
     Colonel or, as is equally possible, that the Colonel fell down from
     sheer fright at the sight of him, and cut his head on the corner of
     the fender.  Finally, we have the curious fact that the intruder
     carried away the key with him when he left."

     "Your discoveries seem to have left the business more obscure that it
     was before," said I.

     "Quite so.  They undoubtedly showed that the affair was much deeper
     than was at first conjectured.  I thought the matter over, and I came
     to the conclusion that I must approach the case from another aspect. 
     But really, Watson, I am keeping you up, and I might just as well
     tell you all this on our way to Aldershot to-morrow."

     "Thank you, you have gone rather too far to stop."

     "It is quite certain that when Mrs. Barclay left the house at
     half-past seven she was on good terms with her husband.  She was
     never, as I think I have said, ostentatiously affectionate, but she
     was heard by the coachman chatting with the Colonel in a friendly
     fashion.  Now, it was equally certain that, immediately on her
     return, she had gone to the room in which she was least likely to see
     her husband, had flown to tea as an agitated woman will, and finally,
     on his coming in to her, had broken into violent recriminations. 
     Therefore something had occurred between seven-thirty and nine
     o'clock which had completely altered her feelings towards him.  But

                        THE ADVENTURE OF THE SECOND STAIN

     I had intended "The Adventure of the Abbey Grange" to be the last of
     those exploits of my friend, Mr. Sherlock Holmes, which I should ever
     communicate to the public. This resolution of mine was not due to any
     lack of material, since I have notes of many hundreds of cases to
     which I have never alluded, nor was it caused by any waning interest
     on the part of my readers in the singular personality and unique
     methods of this remarkable man. The real reason lay in the reluctance
     which Mr. Holmes has shown to the continued publication of his
     experiences. So long as he was in actual professional practice the
     records of his successes were of some practical value to him; but
     since he has definitely retired from London and betaken himself to
     study and bee-farming on the Sussex Downs, notoriety has become
     hateful to him, and he has peremptorily requested that his wishes in
     this matter should be strictly observed. It was only upon my
     representing to him that I had given a promise that "The Adventure of
     the Second Stain" should be published when the times were ripe, and
     pointing out to him that it is only appropriate that this long series
     of episodes should culminate in the most important international case
     which he has ever been called upon to handle, that I at last
     succeeded in obtaining his consent that a carefully-guarded account
     of the incident should at last be laid before the public. If in
     telling the story I seem to be somewhat vague in certain details the
     public will readily understand that there is an excellent reason for
     my reticence.

     It was, then, in a year, and even in a decade, that shall be
     nameless, that upon one Tuesday morning in autumn we found two
     visitors of European fame within the walls of our humble room in
     Baker Street. The one, austere, high-nosed, eagle-eyed, and dominant,
     was none other than the illustrious Lord Bellinger, twice Premier of
     Britain. The other, dark, clear-cut, and elegant, hardly yet of
     middle age, and endowed with every beauty of body and of mind, was
     the Right Honourable Trelawney Hope, Secretary for European Affairs,
     and the most rising statesman in the country. They sat side by side
     upon our paper-littered settee, and it was easy to see from their
     worn and anxious faces that it was business of the most pressing
     importance which had brought them. The Premier's thin, blue-veined
     hands were clasped tightly over the ivory head of his umbrella, and
     his gaunt, ascetic face looked gloomily from Holmes to me. The
     European Secretary pulled nervously at his moustache and fidgeted
     with the seals of his watch-chain.

     "When I discovered my loss, Mr. Holmes, which was at eight o'clock
     this morning, I at once informed the Prime Minister. It was at his
     suggestion that we have both come to you."

     "Have you informed the police?"

     "No, sir," said the Prime Minister, with the quick, decisive manner
     for which he was famous. "We have not done so, nor is it possible
     that we should do so. To inform the police must, in the long run,
     mean to inform the public. This is what we particularly desire to
     avoid."

     "And why, sir?"

     "Because the document in question is of such immense importance that
     its publication might very easily--I might almost say probably--lead
     to European complications of the utmost moment. It is not too much to
     say that peace or war may hang upon the issue. Unless its recovery
     can be attended with the utmost secrecy, then it may as well not be
     recovered at all, for all that is aimed at by those who have taken it
     is that its contents should be generally known."

     "I understand. Now, Mr. Trelawney Hope, I should be much obliged if
     you would tell me exactly the circumstances under which this document
     disappeared."

     "That can be done in a very few words, Mr. Holmes. The letter--for it
     was a letter from a foreign potentate--was received six days ago. It
     was of such importance that I have never left it in my safe, but I
     have taken it across each evening to my house in Whitehall Terrace,
     and kept it in my bedroom in a locked despatch-box. It was there last
     night. Of that I am certain. I actually opened the box while I was
     dressing for dinner, and saw the document inside. This morning it was
     gone. The despatch-box had stood beside the glass upon my
     dressing-table all night. I am a light sleeper, and so is my wife. We
     are both prepared to swear that no one could have entered the room
     during the night. And yet I repeat that the paper is gone."

     "What time did you dine?"

     "Half-past seven."

     "How long was it before you went to bed?"

     "My wife had gone to the theatre. I waited up for her. It was
     half-past eleven before we went to our room."

     "Then for four hours the despatch-box had lain unguarded?"

     "No one is ever permitted to enter that room save the housemaid in
     the morning, and my valet, or my wife's maid, during the rest of the
     day. They are both trusty servants who have been with us for some
     time. Besides, neither of them could possibly have known that there
     was anything more valuable than the ordinary departmental papers in
     my despatch-box."

     "Who did know of the existence of that letter?"

     "No one in the house."

     "Surely your wife knew?"

     "No, sir; I had said nothing to my wife until I missed the paper this
     morning."

     The Premier nodded approvingly.

     "I have long known, sir, how high is your sense of public duty," said
     he. "I am convinced that in the case of a secret of this importance
     it would rise superior to the most intimate domestic ties."

     The European Secretary bowed.

     "You do me no more than justice, sir. Until this morning I have never
     breathed one word to my wife upon this matter."

     "Could she have guessed?"

     "No, Mr. Holmes, she could not have guessed--nor could anyone have
     guessed."

     "Have you lost any documents before?"

     "No, sir."

     "Who is there in England who did know of the existence of this
     letter?"

     "Each member of the Cabinet was informed of it yesterday; but the
     pledge of secrecy which attends every Cabinet meeting was increased
     by the solemn warning which was given by the Prime Minister. Good
     heavens, to think that within a few hours I should myself have lost
     it!" His handsome face was distorted with a spasm of despair, and his
     hands tore at his hair. For a moment we caught a glimpse of the
     natural man, impulsive, ardent, keenly sensitive. The next the
     aristocratic mask was replaced, and the gentle voice had returned.
     "Besides the members of the Cabinet there are two, or possibly three,
     departmental officials who know of the letter. No one else in
     England, Mr. Holmes, I assure you."

     "But abroad?"

     "I believe that no one abroad has seen it save the man who wrote it.
     I am well convinced that his Ministers--that the usual official
     channels have not been employed."

     Holmes considered for some little time.

     "Now, sir, I must ask you more particularly what this document is,
     and why its disappearance should have such momentous consequences?"

     The two statesmen exchanged a quick glance and the Premier's shaggy
     eyebrows gathered in a frown.

     "Mr. Holmes, the envelope is a long, thin one of pale blue colour.
     There is a seal of red wax stamped with a crouching lion. It is
     addressed in large, bold handwriting to--"

     "I fear, sir," said Holmes, "that, interesting and indeed essential
     as these details are, my inquiries must go more to the root of
     things. What was the letter?"

     "That is a State secret of the utmost importance, and I fear that I
     cannot tell you, nor do I see that it is necessary. If by the aid of
     the powers which you are said to possess you can find such an
     envelope as I describe with its enclosure, you will have deserved
     well of your country, and earned any reward which it lies in our
     power to bestow."

     Sherlock Holmes rose with a smile.

     "You are two of the most busy men in the country," said he, "and in
     my own small way I have also a good many calls upon me. I regret
     exceedingly that I cannot help you in this matter, and any
     continuation of this interview would be a waste of time."

     The Premier sprang to his feet with that quick, fierce gleam of his
     deep-set eyes before which a Cabinet has cowered. "I am not
     accustomed, sir--" he began, but mastered his anger and resumed his
     seat. For a minute or more we all sat in silence. Then the old
     statesman shrugged his shoulders.

     "We must accept your terms, Mr. Holmes. No doubt you are right, and
     it is unreasonable for us to expect you to act unless we give you our
     entire confidence."

     "I agree with you, sir," said the younger statesman.

     "Then I will tell you, relying entirely upon your honour and that of
     your colleague, Dr. Watson. I may appeal to your patriotism also, for
     I could not imagine a greater misfortune for the country than that
     this affair should come out."

     "You may safely trust us."

     "The letter, then, is from a certain foreign potentate who has been
     ruffled by some recent Colonial developments of this country. It has
     been written hurriedly and upon his own responsibility entirely.
     Inquiries have shown that his Ministers know nothing of the matter.
     At the same time it is couched in so unfortunate a manner, and
     certain phrases in it are of so provocative a character, that its
     publication would undoubtedly lead to a most dangerous state of
     feeling in this country. There would be such a ferment, sir, that I
     do not hesitate to say that within a week of the publication of that
     letter this country would be involved in a great war."

     Holmes wrote a name upon a slip of paper and handed it to the
     Premier.

     "Exactly. It was he. And it is this letter--this letter which may
     well mean the expenditure of a thousand millions and the lives of a
     hundred thousand men--which has become lost in this unaccountable
     fashion."

     "Have you informed the sender?"

     "Yes, sir, a cipher telegram has been despatched."

     "Perhaps he desires the publication of the letter."

     "No, sir, we have strong reason to believe that he already
     understands that he has acted in an indiscreet and hot-headed manner.
     It would be a greater blow to him and to his country than to us if
     this letter were to come out."

     "If this is so, whose interest is it that the letter should come out?
     Why should anyone desire to steal it or to publish it?"

     "There, Mr. Holmes, you take me into regions of high international
     politics. But if you consider the European situation you will have no
     difficulty in perceiving the motive. The whole of Europe is an armed
     camp. There is a double league which makes a fair balance of military
     power. Great Britain holds the scales. If Britain were driven into
     war with one confederacy, it would assure the supremacy of the other
     confederacy, whether they joined in the war or not. Do you follow?"

     "Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this
     potentate to secure and publish this letter, so as to make a breach
     between his country and ours?"

     "Yes, sir."

     "And to whom would this document be sent if it fell into the hands of
     an enemy?"

     "To any of the great Chancelleries of Europe. It is probably speeding
     on its way thither at the present instant as fast as steam can take
     it."

     Mr. Trelawney Hope dropped his head on his chest and groaned aloud.
     The Premier placed his hand kindly upon his shoulder.

     "It is your misfortune, my dear fellow. No one can blame you. There
     is no precaution which you have neglected. Now, Mr. Holmes, you are
     in full possession of the facts. What course do you recommend?"

     Holmes shook his head mournfully.

     "You think, sir, that unless this document is recovered there will be
     war?"

     "I think it is very probable."

     "Then, sir, prepare for war."

     "That is a hard saying, Mr. Holmes."

     "Consider the facts, sir. It is inconceivable that it was taken after
     eleven-thirty at night, since I understand that Mr. Hope and his wife
     were both in the room from that hour until the loss was found out. It
     was taken, then, yesterday evening between seven-thirty and
     eleven-thirty, probably near the earlier hour, since whoever took it
     evidently knew that it was there and would naturally secure it as
     early as possible. Now, sir, if a document of this importance were
     taken at that hour, where can it be now? No one has any reason to
     retain it. It has been passed rapidly on to those who need it. What
     chance have we now to overtake or even to trace it? It is beyond our
     reach."

     The Prime Minister rose from the settee.

     "What you say is perfectly logical, Mr. Holmes. I feel that the
     matter is indeed out of our hands."

     "Let us presume, for argument's sake, that the document was taken by
     the maid or by the valet--"

     "They are both old and tried servants."

     "I understand you to say that your room is on the second floor, that
     there is no entrance from without, and that from within no one could
     go up unobserved. It must, then, be somebody in the house who has
     taken it. To whom would the thief take it? To one of several
     international spies and secret agents, whose names are tolerably
     familiar to me. There are three who may be said to be the heads of
     their profession. I will begin my research by going round and finding
     if each of them is at his post. If one is missing--especially if he
     has disappeared since last night--we will have some indication as to
     where the document has gone."

     "Why should he be missing?" asked the European Secretary. "He would
     take the letter to an Embassy in London, as likely as not."

     "I fancy not. These agents work independently, and their relations
     with the Embassies are often strained."

     The Prime Minister nodded his acquiescence.

     "I believe you are right, Mr. Holmes. He would take so valuable a
     prize to head-quarters with his own hands. I think that your course
     of action is an excellent one. Meanwhile, Hope, we cannot neglect all
     our other duties on account of this one misfortune. Should there be
     any fresh developments during the day we shall communicate with you,
     and you will no doubt let us know the results of your own inquiries."

     The two statesmen bowed and walked gravely from the room.

     When our illustrious visitors had departed Holmes lit his pipe in
     silence, and sat for some time lost in the deepest thought. I had
     opened the morning paper and was immersed in a sensational crime
     which had occurred in London the night before, when my friend gave an
     exclamation, sprang to his feet, and laid his pipe down upon the
     mantelpiece.

     "Yes," said he, "there is no better way of approaching it. The
     situation is desperate, but not hopeless. Even now, if we could be
     sure which of them has taken it, it is just possible that it has not
     yet passed out of his hands. After all, it is a question of money
     with these fellows, and I have the British Treasury behind me. If
     it's on the market I'll buy it--if it means another penny on the
     income-tax. It is conceivable that the fellow might hold it back to
     see what bids come from this side before he tries his luck on the
     other. There are only those three capable of playing so bold a game;
     there are Oberstein, La Rothiere, and Eduardo Lucas. I will see each
     of them."

     I glanced at my morning paper.

     "Is that Eduardo Lucas of Godolphin Street?"

     "Yes."

     "You will not see him."

     "Why not?"

     "He was murdered in his house last night."

     My friend has so often astonished me in the course of our adventures
     that it was with a sense of exultation that I realized how completely
     I had astonished him. He stared in amazement, and then snatched the
     paper from my hands. This was the paragraph which I had been engaged
     in reading when he rose from his chair:

                              Murder in Westminster
     A crime of mysterious character was committed last night at 16,
     Godolphin Street, one of the old-fashioned and secluded rows of
     eighteenth-century houses which lie between the river and the Abbey,
     almost in the shadow of the great Tower of the Houses of Parliament.
     This small but select mansion has been inhabited for some years by
     Mr. Eduardo Lucas, well known in society circles both on account of
     his charming personality and because he has the well-deserved
     reputation of being one of the best amateur tenors in the country.
     Mr. Lucas is an unmarried man, thirty-four years of age, and his
     establishment consists of Mrs. Pringle, an elderly housekeeper, and
     of Mitton, his valet. The former retires early and sleeps at the top
     of the house. The valet was out for the evening, visiting a friend at
     Hammersmith. From ten o'clock onwards Mr. Lucas had the house to
     himself. What occurred during that time has not yet transpired, but
     at a quarter to twelve Police-constable Barrett, passing along
     Godolphin Street, observed that the door of No. 16 was ajar. He
     knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the front room
     he advanced into the passage and again knocked, but without reply. He
     then pushed open the door and entered. The room was in a state of
     wild disorder, the furniture being all swept to one side, and one
     chair lying on its back in the centre. Beside this chair, and still
     grasping one of its legs, lay the unfortunate tenant of the house. He
     had been stabbed to the heart and must have died instantly. The knife
     with which the crime had been committed was a curved Indian dagger,
     plucked down from a trophy of Oriental arms which adorned one of the
     walls. Robbery does not appear to have been the motive of the crime,
     for there had been no attempt to remove the valuable contents of the
     room. Mr. Eduardo Lucas was so well known and popular that his
     violent and mysterious fate will arouse painful interest and intense
     sympathy in a wide-spread circle of friends.

     "Well, Watson, what do you make of this?" asked Holmes, after a long
     pause.

     "It is an amazing coincidence."

     "A coincidence! Here is one of the three men whom we had named as
     possible actors in this drama, and he meets a violent death during
     the very hours when we know that that drama was being enacted. The
     odds are enormous against its being coincidence. No figures could
     express them. No, my dear Watson, the two events are connected--must
     be connected. It is for us to find the connection."

     "But now the official police must know all."

     "Not at all. They know all they see at Godolphin Street. They
     know--and shall know--nothing of Whitehall Terrace. Only we know of
     both events, and can trace the relation between them. There is one
     obvious point which would, in any case, have turned my suspicions
     against Lucas. Godolphin Street, Westminster, is only a few minutes'
     walk from Whitehall Terrace. The other secret agents whom I have
     named live in the extreme West-end. It was easier, therefore, for
     Lucas than for the others to establish a connection or receive a
     message from the European Secretary's household--a small thing, and
     yet where events are compressed into a few hours it may prove
     essential. Halloa! what have we here?"

     Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes
     glanced at it, raised his eyebrows, and handed it over to me.

     "Ask Lady Hilda Trelawney Hope if she will be kind enough to step
     up," said he.

     A moment later our modest apartment, already so distinguished that
     morning, was further honoured by the entrance of the most lovely
     woman in London. I had often heard of the beauty of the youngest
     daughter of the Duke of Belminster, but no description of it, and no
     contemplation of colourless photographs, had prepared me for the
     subtle, delicate charm and the beautiful colouring of that exquisite
     head. And yet as we saw it that autumn morning, it was not its beauty
     which would be the first thing to impress the observer. The cheek was
     lovely, but it was paled with emotion; the eyes were bright, but it
     was the brightness of fever; the sensitive mouth was tight and drawn
     in an effort after self-command. Terror--not beauty--was what sprang
     first to the eye as our fair visitor stood framed for an instant in
     the open door.

     "Has my husband been here, Mr. Holmes?"

     "Yes, madam, he has been here."

     "Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here." Holmes
     bowed coldly, and motioned the lady to a chair.

     "Your ladyship places me in a very delicate position. I beg that you
     will sit down and tell me what you desire; but I fear that I cannot
     make any unconditional promise."

     She swept across the room and seated herself with her back to the
     window. It was a queenly presence--tall, graceful, and intensely
     womanly.

     "Mr. Holmes," she said, and her white-gloved hands clasped and
     unclasped as she spoke--"I will speak frankly to you in the hope that
     it may induce you to speak frankly in return. There is complete
     confidence between my husband and me on all matters save one. That
     one is politics. On this his lips are sealed. He tells me nothing.
     Now, I am aware that there was a most deplorable occurrence in our
     house last night. I know that a paper has disappeared. But because
     the matter is political my husband refuses to take me into his
     complete confidence. Now it is essential--essential, I say--that I
     should thoroughly understand it. You are the only other person, save
     only these politicians, who knows the true facts. I beg you, then,
     Mr. Holmes, to tell me exactly what has happened and what it will
     lead to. Tell me all, Mr. Holmes. Let no regard for your client's
     interests keep you silent, for I assure you that his interests, if he
     would only see it, would be best served by taking me into his
     complete confidence. What was this paper which was stolen?"

     "Madam, what you ask me is really impossible."

     She groaned and sank her face in her hands.

     "You must see that this is so, madam. If your husband thinks fit to
     keep you in the dark over this matter, is it for me, who has only
     learned the true facts under the pledge of professional secrecy, to
     tell what he has withheld? It is not fair to ask it. It is him whom
     you must ask."

     "I have asked him. I come to you as a last resource. But without your
     telling me anything definite, Mr. Holmes, you may do a great service
     if you would enlighten me on one point."

     "What is it, madam?"

     "Is my husband's political career likely to suffer through this
     incident?"

     "Well, madam, unless it is set right it may certainly have a very
     unfortunate effect."

     "Ah!" She drew in her breath sharply as one whose doubts are
     resolved.

     "One more question, Mr. Holmes. From an expression which my husband
     dropped in the first shock of this disaster I understood that
     terrible public consequences might arise from the loss of this
     document."


Iteration: 35000
     "There you are," said Holmes, smiling. "It was a dangerous, reckless
     attempt, in which I seem to trace the influence of young Alec. Having
     found nothing they tried to divert suspicion by making it appear to
     be an ordinary burglary, to which end they carried off whatever they
     could lay their hands upon. That is all clear enough, but there was
     much that was still obscure. What I wanted above all was to get the
     missing part of that note. I was certain that Alec had torn it out of
     the dead man's hand, and almost certain that he must have thrust it
     into the pocket of his dressing-gown. Where else could he have put
     it? The only question was whether it was still there. It was worth an
     effort to find out, and for that object we all went up to the house.

     "The Cunninghams joined us, as you doubtless remember, outside the
     kitchen door. It was, of course, of the very first importance that
     they should not be reminded of the existence of this paper, otherwise
     they would naturally destroy it without delay. The Inspector was
     about to tell them the importance which we attached to it when, by
     the luckiest chance in the world, I tumbled down in a sort of fit and
     so changed the conversation."

     "Good heavens!" cried the Colonel, laughing, "do you mean to say all
     our sympathy was wasted and your fit an imposture?"

     "Speaking professionally, it was admirably done," cried I, looking in
     amazement at this man who was forever confounding me with some new
     phase of his astuteness.

     "It is an art which is often useful," said he. "When I recovered I
     managed, by a device which had perhaps some little merit of
     ingenuity, to get old Cunningham to write the word 'twelve,' so that
     I might compare it with the 'twelve' upon the paper."

     "Oh, what an ass I have been!" I exclaimed.

     "I could see that you were commiserating with me over my weakness,"
     said Holmes, laughing. "I was sorry to cause you the sympathetic pain
     which I know that you felt. We then went upstairs together, and
     having entered the room and seen the dressing-gown hanging up behind
     the door, I contrived, by upsetting a table, to engage their
     attention for the moment, and slipped back to examine the pockets. I
     had hardly got the paper, however--which was, as I had expected, in
     one of them--when the two Cunninghams were on me, and would, I verily
     believe, have murdered me then and there but for your prompt and
     friendly aid. As it is, I feel that young man's grip on my throat
     now, and the father has twisted my wrist round in the effort to get
     the paper out of my hand. They saw that I must know all about it, you
     see, and the sudden change from absolute security to complete despair
     made them perfectly desperate.

     "I had a little talk with old Cunningham afterwards as to the motive
     of the crime. He was tractable enough, though his son was a perfect
     demon, ready to blow out his own or anybody else's brains if he could
     have got to his revolver. When Cunningham saw that the case against
     him was so strong he lost all heart and made a clean breast of
     everything. It seems that William had secretly followed his two
     masters on the night when they made their raid upon Mr. Acton's, and
     having thus got them into his power, proceeded, under threats of
     exposure, to levy black-mail upon them. Mr. Alec, however, was a
     dangerous man to play games of that sort with. It was a stroke of
     positive genius on his part to see in the burglary scare which was
     convulsing the country side an opportunity of plausibly getting rid
     of the man whom he feared. William was decoyed up and shot, and had
     they only got the whole of the note and paid a little more attention
     to detail in the accessories, it is very possible that suspicion
     might never have been aroused."

     "And the note?" I asked.

     Sherlock Holmes placed the subjoined paper before us.

     [ Picture: Paper which reads: If you will only come around at quarter
     to twelve to the east gate you will learn what will very much
     surprise you and may be of the greatest service to you and also to
     Annie Morrison. But say nothing to anyone upon the matter ]

     "It is very much the sort of thing that I expected," said he. "Of
     course, we do not yet know what the relations may have been between
     Alec Cunningham, William Kirwan, and Annie Morrison. The results
     shows that the trap was skillfully baited. I am sure that you cannot
     fail to be delighted with the traces of heredity shown in the p's and
     in the tails of the g's. The absence of the i-dots in the old man's
     writing is also most characteristic. Watson, I think our quiet rest
     in the country has been a distinct success, and I shall certainly
     return much invigorated to Baker Street to-morrow." 






                                 THE CROOKED MAN

     One summer night, a few months after my marriage, I was seated by my
     own hearth smoking a last pipe and nodding over a novel, for my day's
     work had been an exhausting one.  My wife had already gone upstairs,
     and the sound of the locking of the hall door some time before told
     me that the servants had also retired.  I had risen from my seat and
     was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang
     of the bell.

     I looked at the clock.  It was a quarter to twelve.  This could not
     be a visitor at so late an hour.  A patient, evidently, and possibly
     an all-night sitting.  With a wry face I went out into the hall and
     opened the door.  To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood
     upon my step.

     "Ah, Watson," said he, "I hoped that I might not be too late to catch
     you."

     "My dear fellow, pray come in."

     "You look surprised, and no wonder!  Relieved, too, I fancy!  Hum! 
     You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then! 
     There's no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat.  It's easy to
     tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson.  You'll
     never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of
     carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve.  Could you put me up
     tonight?"

     "With pleasure."

     "You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that
     you have no gentleman visitor at present.  Your hat-stand proclaims
     wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the
     terror, wringing his hands and moaning to himself. Suddenly, however,
     distinguishing features."

     "What time was that?"

     "It was ten o'clock. And now he is dead, and the police will be
     called in, and I shall be suspected of having had a hand in it. Oh,
     yes, I am sure I shall. But you don't think so, gentlemen? Surely you
     don't think that it was I? Is it likely that I would have brought you
     here if it were I? Oh, dear! oh, dear! I know that I shall go mad!"
     He jerked his arms and stamped his feet in a kind of convulsive
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love
     which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give
     He saw every step which I took to draw my toils round him.  Again and
     me that the servants had also retired.  I had risen from my seat and
     was knocking out the ashes of my pipe when I suddenly heard the clang
     of the bell.

     I looked at the clock.  It was a quarter to twelve.  This could not
     be a visitor at so late an hour.  A patient, evidently, and possibly
     an all-night sitting.  With a wry face I went out into the hall and
     opened the door.  To my astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood
     upon my step.

     "Ah, Watson," said he, "I hoped that I might not be too late to catch
     you."

     "My dear fellow, pray come in."

     "You look surprised, and no wonder!  Relieved, too, I fancy!  Hum! 
     You still smoke the Arcadia mixture of your bachelor days then! 
     There's no mistaking that fluffy ash upon your coat.  It's easy to
     tell that you have been accustomed to wear a uniform, Watson.  You'll
     never pass as a pure-bred civilian as long as you keep that habit of
     carrying your handkerchief in your sleeve.  Could you put me up
     tonight?"

     "With pleasure."

     "You told me that you had bachelor quarters for one, and I see that
     you have no gentleman visitor at present.  Your hat-stand proclaims
     as much."

     "I shall be delighted if you will stay."

     "Thank you.  I'll fill the vacant peg then.  Sorry to see that you've
     had the British workman in the house.  He's a token of evil.  Not the
     drains, I hope?"

     "No, the gas."

     "Ah!  He has left two nail-marks from his boot upon your linoleum
     just where the light strikes it.  No, thank you, I had some supper at
     Waterloo, but I'll smoke a pipe with you with pleasure."

     I handed him my pouch, and he seated himself opposite to me and
     smoked for some time in silence.  I was well aware that nothing but
     business of importance would have brought him to me at such an hour,
     so I waited patiently until he should come round to it.

     "I see that you are professionally rather busy just now," said he,
     glancing very keenly across at me.

     "Yes, I've had a busy day," I answered.  "It may seem very foolish in
     your eyes," I added, "but really I don't know how you deduced it."

     Holmes chuckled to himself.

     "I have the advantage of knowing your habits, my dear Watson," said
     he.  "When your round is a short one you walk, and when it is a long
     one you use a hansom.  As I perceive that your boots, although used,
     are by no means dirty, I cannot doubt that you are at present busy
     enough to justify the hansom."

     "Excellent!" I cried.

     "Elementary," said he.  "It is one of those instances where the
     reasoner can produce an effect which seems remarkable to his
     neighbor, because the latter has missed the one little point which is
     the basis of the deduction.  The same may be said, my dear fellow,
     for the effect of some of these little sketches of yours, which is
     entirely meretricious, depending as it does upon your retaining in
     your own hands some factors in the problem which are never imparted
     to the reader.  Now, at present I am in the position of these same
     readers, for I hold in this hand several threads of one of the
     strangest cases which ever perplexed a man's brain, and yet I lack
     the one or two which are needful to complete my theory.  But I'll
     have them, Watson, I'll have them!"  His eyes kindled and a slight
     flush sprang into his thin cheeks. For an instant the veil had lifted
     upon his keen, intense nature, but for an instant only. When I
     glanced again his face had resumed that red-Indian composure which
     had made so many regard him as a machine rather than a man.

     "The problem presents features of interest," said he.  "I may even
     say exceptional features of interest.  I have already looked into the
     matter, and have come, as I think, within sight of my solution.  If
     you could accompany me in that last step you might be of considerable
     service to me."

     "I should be delighted."

     "Could you go as far as Aldershot to-morrow?"

     "I have no doubt Jackson would take my practice."

     "Very good.  I want to start by the 11.10 from Waterloo."

     "That would give me time."

     "Then, if you are not too sleepy, I will give you a sketch of what
     has happened, and of what remains to be done."

     "I was sleepy before you came.  I am quite wakeful now."

     "I will compress the story as far as may be done without omitting
     anything vital to the case.  It is conceivable that you may even have
     read some account of the matter.  It is the supposed murder of
     Colonel Barclay, of the Royal Munsters, at Aldershot, which I am
     investigating."

     "I have heard nothing of it."

     "It has not excited much attention yet, except locally.  The facts
     are only two days old.  Briefly they are these:

     "The Royal Munsters is, as you know, one of the most famous Irish
     regiments in the British army.  It did wonders both in the Crimea and
     the Mutiny, and has since that time distinguished itself upon every
     possible occasion.  It was commanded up to Monday night by James
     Barclay, a gallant veteran, who started as a full private, was raised
     to commissioned rank for his bravery at the time of the Mutiny, and
     so lived to command the regiment in which he had once carried a
     musket.

     "Colonel Barclay had married at the time when he was a sergeant, and
     his wife, whose maiden name was Miss Nancy Devoy, was the daughter of
     a former color-sergeant in the same corps.  There was, therefore, as
     can be imagined, some little social friction when the young couple
     (for they were still young) found themselves in their new
     surroundings.  They appear, however, to have quickly adapted
     themselves, and Mrs. Barclay has always, I understand, been as
     popular with the ladies of the regiment as her husband was with his
     brother officers.  I may add that she was a woman of great beauty,
     and that even now, when she has been married for upwards of thirty
     years, she is still of a striking and queenly appearance.

     "Colonel Barclay's family life appears to have been a uniformly happy
     one.  Major Murphy, to whom I owe most of my facts, assures me that
     he has never heard of any misunderstanding between the pair.  On the
     whole, he thinks that Barclay's devotion to his wife was greater than
     his wife's to Barclay.  He was acutely uneasy if he were absent from
     her for a day.  She, on the other hand, though devoted and faithful,
     was less obtrusively affectionate.  But they were regarded in the
     regiment as the very model of a middle-aged couple.  There was
     absolutely nothing in their mutual relations to prepare people for
     the tragedy which was to follow.

     "Colonel Barclay himself seems to have had some singular traits in
     his character.  He was a dashing, jovial old solder in his usual
     mood, but there were occasions on which he seemed to show himself
     capable of considerable violence and vindictiveness.  This side of
     his nature, however, appears never to have been turned towards his
     wife.  Another fact, which had struck Major Murphy and three out of
     five of the other officers with whom I conversed, was the singular
     sort of depression which came upon him at times.  As the major
     expressed it, the smile had often been struck from his mouth, as if
     by some invisible hand, when he has been joining the gaieties and
     chaff of the mess-table.  For days on end, when the mood was on him,
     he has been sunk in the deepest gloom.  This and a certain tinge of
     superstition were the only unusual traits in his character which his
     brother officers had observed.  The latter peculiarity took the form
     of a dislike to being left alone, especially after dark.  This
     puerile feature in a nature which was conspicuously manly had often
     given rise to comment and conjecture.

     "The first battalion of the Royal Munsters (which is the old 117th)
     has been stationed at Aldershot for some years.  The married officers
     live out of barracks, and the Colonel has during all this time
     occupied a villa called Lachine, about half a mile from the north
     camp.  The house stands in its own grounds, but the west side of it
     is not more than thirty yards from the high-road.  A coachman and two
     maids form the staff of servants.  These with their master and
     mistress were the sole occupants of Lachine, for the Barclays had no
     children, nor was it usual for them to have resident visitors.

     "Now for the events at Lachine between nine and ten on the evening of
     last Monday.

     "Mrs. Barclay was, it appears, a member of the Roman Catholic Church,
     and had interested herself very much in the establishment of the
     Guild of St. George, which was formed in connection with the Watt
     Street Chapel for the purpose of supplying the poor with cast-off
     clothing.  A meeting of the Guild had been held that evening at
     eight, and Mrs. Barclay had hurried over her dinner in order to be
     present at it.  When leaving the house she was heard by the coachman
     to make some commonplace remark to her husband, and to assure him
     that she would be back before very long. She then called for Miss
     Morrison, a young lady who lives in the next villa, and the two went
     off together to their meeting.  It lasted forty minutes, and at a
     quarter-past nine Mrs. Barclay returned home, having left Miss
     Morrison at her door as she passed.

     "There is a room which is used as a morning-room at Lachine.  This
     faces the road and opens by a large glass folding-door on to the
     lawn.  The lawn is thirty yards across, and is only divided from the
     highway by a low wall with an iron rail above it.  It was into this
     room that Mrs. Barclay went upon her return.  The blinds were not
     down, for the room was seldom used in the evening, but Mrs. Barclay
     herself lit the lamp and then rang the bell, asking Jane Stewart, the
     house-maid, to bring her a cup of tea, which was quite contrary to
     her usual habits.  The Colonel had been sitting in the dining-room,
     but hearing that his wife had returned he joined her in the
     morning-room.  The coachman saw him cross the hall and enter it.  He
     was never seen again alive.

     "The tea which had been ordered was brought up at the end of ten
     minutes; but the maid, as she approached the door, was surprised to
     hear the voices of her master and mistress in furious altercation. 
     She knocked without receiving any answer, and even turned the handle,
     but only to find that the door was locked upon the inside.  Naturally
     enough she ran down to tell the cook, and the two women with the
     coachman came up into the hall and listened to the dispute which was
     still raging.  They all agreed that only two voices were to be heard,
     those of Barclay and of his wife.  Barclay's remarks were subdued and
     abrupt, so that none of them were audible to the listeners.  The
     lady's, on the other hand, were most bitter, and when she raised her
     voice could be plainly heard.  'You coward!' she repeated over and
     over again.  'What can be done now?  What can be done now?  Give me
     back my life.  I will never so much as breathe the same air with you
     again!  You coward!  You Coward!'  Those were scraps of her
     conversation, ending in a sudden dreadful cry in the man's voice,
     with a crash, and a piercing scream from the woman.  Convinced that
     some tragedy had occurred, the coachman rushed to the door and strove
     to force it, while scream after scream issued from within.  He was
     unable, however, to make his way in, and the maids were too
     distracted with fear to be of any assistance to him.  A sudden
     thought struck him, however, and he ran through the hall door and
     round to the lawn upon which the long French windows open.  One side
     of the window was open, which I understand was quite usual in the
     summer-time, and he passed without difficulty into the room.  His
     mistress had ceased to scream and was stretched insensible upon a
     couch, while with his feet tilted over the side of an arm-chair, and
     his head upon the ground near the corner of the fender, was lying the
     unfortunate soldier stone dead in a pool of his own blood.

     "Naturally, the coachman's first thought, on finding that he could do
     nothing for his master, was to open the door.  But here an unexpected
     and singular difficulty presented itself.  The key was not in the
     inner side of the door, nor could he find it anywhere in the room. 
     He went out again, therefore, through the window, and having obtained
     the help of a policeman and of a medical man, he returned.  The lady,
     against whom naturally the strongest suspicion rested, was removed to
     her room, still in a state of insensibility.  The Colonel's body was
     then placed upon the sofa, and a careful examination made of the
     scene of the tragedy.

     "The injury from which the unfortunate veteran was suffering was
     found to be a jagged cut some two inches long at the back part of his
     head, which had evidently been caused by a violent blow from a blunt
     weapon.  Nor was it difficult to guess what that weapon may have
     been.  Upon the floor, close to the body, was lying a singular club
     of hard carved wood with a bone handle.  The Colonel possessed a
     varied collection of weapons brought from the different countries in
     which he had fought, and it is conjectured by the police that his
     club was among his trophies.  The servants deny having seen it
     before, but among the numerous curiosities in the house it is
     possible that it may have been overlooked.  Nothing else of
     importance was discovered in the room by the police, save the
     inexplicable fact that neither upon Mrs. Barclay's person nor upon
     that of the victim nor in any part of the room was the missing key to
     be found.  The door had eventually to be opened by a locksmith from
     Aldershot.

     "That was the state of things, Watson, when upon the Tuesday morning
     I, at the request of Major Murphy, went down to Aldershot to
     supplement the efforts of the police.  I think that you will
     acknowledge that the problem was already one of interest, but my
     observations soon made me realize that it was in truth much more
     extraordinary than would at first sight appear.

     "Before examining the room I cross-questioned the servants, but only
     succeeded in eliciting the facts which I have already stated.  One
     other detail of interest was remembered by Jane Stewart, the
     housemaid.  You will remember that on hearing the sound of the
     quarrel she descended and returned with the other servants.  On that
     first occasion, when she was alone, she says that the voices of her
     master and mistress were sunk so low that she could hear hardly
     anything, and judged by their tones rather than their words that they
     had fallen out.  On my pressing her, however, she remembered that she
     heard the word David uttered twice by the lady.  The point is of the
     utmost importance as guiding us towards the reason of the sudden
     quarrel.  The Colonel's name, you remember, was James.

     "There was one thing in the case which had made the deepest
     impression both upon the servants and the police.  This was the
     contortion of the Colonel's face.  It had set, according to their
     account, into the most dreadful expression of fear and horror which a
     human countenance is capable of assuming.  More than one person
     fainted at the mere sight of him, so terrible was the effect.  It was
     quite certain that he had foreseen his fate, and that it had caused
     him the utmost horror.  This, of course, fitted in well enough with
     the police theory, if the Colonel could have seen his wife making a
     murderous attack upon him.  Nor was the fact of the wound being on
     the back of his head a fatal objection to this, as he might have
     turned to avoid the blow.  No information could be got from the lady
     herself, who was temporarily insane from an acute attack of
     brain-fever.

     "From the police I learned that Miss Morrison, who you remember went
     out that evening with Mrs. Barclay, denied having any knowledge of
     what it was which had caused the ill-humor in which her companion had
     returned.

     "Having gathered these facts, Watson, I smoked several pipes over
     them, trying to separate those which were crucial from others which
     were merely incidental.  There could be no question that the most
     distinctive and suggestive point in the case was the singular
     disappearance of the door-key.  A most careful search had failed to
     discover it in the room.  Therefore it must have been taken from it. 
     But neither the Colonel nor the Colonel's wife could have taken it. 
     That was perfectly clear.  Therefore a third person must have entered
     the room.  And that third person could only have come in through the
     window.  It seemed to me that a careful examination of the room and
     the lawn might possibly reveal some traces of this mysterious
     individual.  You know my methods, Watson.  There was not one of them
     which I did not apply to the inquiry.  And it ended by my discovering
     traces, but very different ones from those which I had expected. 
     There had been a man in the room, and he had crossed the lawn coming
     from the road.  I was able to obtain five very clear impressions of
     his foot-marks:  one in the roadway itself, at the point where he had
     climbed the low wall, two on the lawn, and two very faint ones upon
     the stained boards near the window where he had entered.  He had
     apparently rushed across the lawn, for his toe-marks were much deeper
     than his heels.  But it was not the man who surprised me.  It was his
     companion."

     "His companion!"

     Holmes pulled a large sheet of tissue-paper out of his pocket and
     carefully unfolded it upon his knee.

     "What do you make of that?" he asked.

     The paper was covered with the tracings of the foot-marks of some
     small animal.  It had five well-marked foot-pads, an indication of
     long nails, and the whole print might be nearly as large as  a
     dessert-spoon.

     "It's a dog," said I.

     "Did you ever hear of a dog running up a curtain?  I found distinct
     traces that this creature had done so."

     "A monkey, then?"

     "But it is not the print of a monkey."

     "What can it be, then?"

     "Neither dog nor cat nor monkey nor any creature that we are familiar
     with.  I have tried to reconstruct it from the measurements.  Here
     are four prints where the beast has been standing motionless.  You
     see that it is no less than fifteen inches from fore-foot to hind. 
     Add to that the length of neck and head, and you get a creature not
     much less than two feet long--probably more if there is any tail. 
     But now observe this other measurement.  The animal has been moving,
     and we have the length of its stride.  In each case it is only about
     three inches.  You have an indication, you see, of a long body with
     very short legs attached to it.  It has not been considerate enough
     to leave any of its hair behind it.  But its general shape must be
     what I have indicated, and it can run up a curtain, and it is
     carnivorous."

     "How do you deduce that?"


Iteration: 36000
     "Pile it on, men, pile it on!" cried Holmes, looking down into the
     engine-room, while the fierce glow from below beat upon his eager,
     aquiline face. "Get every pound of steam you can."

     "I think we gain a little," said Jones, with his eyes on the Aurora.

     "I am sure of it," said I. "We shall be up with her in a very few
     minutes."

     At that moment, however, as our evil fate would have it, a tug with
     three barges in tow blundered in between us. It was only by putting
     our helm hard down that we avoided a collision, and before we could
     round them and recover our way the Aurora had gained a good two
     hundred yards. She was still, however, well in view, and the murky
     uncertain twilight was setting into a clear starlit night. Our
     boilers were strained to their utmost, and the frail shell vibrated
     and creaked with the fierce energy which was driving us along. We had
     shot through the Pool, past the West India Docks, down the long
     Deptford Reach, and up again after rounding the Isle of Dogs. The
     dull blur in front of us resolved itself now clearly enough into the
     dainty Aurora. Jones turned our search-light upon her, so that we
     could plainly see the figures upon her deck. One man sat by the
     stern, with something black between his knees over which he stooped.
     Beside him lay a dark mass which looked like a Newfoundland dog. The
     boy held the tiller, while against the red glare of the furnace I
     could see old Smith, stripped to the waist, and shovelling coals for
     dear life. They may have had some doubt at first as to whether we
     were really pursuing them, but now as we followed every winding and
     turning which they took there could no longer be any question about
     it. At Greenwich we were about three hundred paces behind them. At
     Blackwall we could not have been more than two hundred and fifty. I
     have coursed many creatures in many countries during my checkered
     career, but never did sport give me such a wild thrill as this mad,
     flying man-hunt down the Thames. Steadily we drew in upon them, yard
     by yard. In the silence of the night we could hear the panting and
     clanking of their machinery. The man in the stern still crouched upon
     the deck, and his arms were moving as though he were busy, while
     every now and then he would look up and measure with a glance the
     distance which still separated us. Nearer we came and nearer. Jones
     yelled to them to stop. We were not more than four boat's lengths
     behind them, both boats flying at a tremendous pace. It was a clear
     reach of the river, with Barking Level upon one side and the
     melancholy Plumstead Marshes upon the other. At our hail the man in
     the stern sprang up from the deck and shook his two clinched fists at
     us, cursing the while in a high, cracked voice. He was a good-sized,
     powerful man, and as he stood poising himself with legs astride I
     could see that from the thigh downwards there was but a wooden stump
     upon the right side. At the sound of his strident, angry cries there
     was movement in the huddled bundle upon the deck. It straightened
     itself into a little black man--the smallest I have ever seen--with a
     great, misshapen head and a shock of tangled, dishevelled hair.
     Holmes had already drawn his revolver, and I whipped out mine at the
     sight of this savage, distorted creature. He was wrapped in some sort
     of dark ulster or blanket, which left only his face exposed; but that
     face was enough to give a man a sleepless night. Never have I seen
     features so deeply marked with all bestiality and cruelty. His small
     eyes glowed and burned with a sombre light, and his thick lips were
     writhed back from his teeth, which grinned and chattered at us with a
     half animal fury.

     "Fire if he raises his hand," said Holmes, quietly. We were within a
     boat's-length by this time, and almost within touch of our quarry. I
     can see the two of them now as they stood, the white man with his
     legs far apart, shrieking out curses, and the unhallowed dwarf with
     his hideous face, and his strong yellow teeth gnashing at us in the
     light of our lantern.

     It was well that we had so clear a view of him. Even as we looked he
     plucked out from under his covering a short, round piece of wood,
     like a school-ruler, and clapped it to his lips. Our pistols rang out
     together. He whirled round, threw up his arms, and with a kind of
     choking cough fell sideways into the stream. I caught one glimpse of
     his venomous, menacing eyes amid the white swirl of the waters. At
     the same moment the wooden-legged man threw himself upon the rudder
     and put it hard down, so that his boat made straight in for the
     southern bank, while we shot past her stern, only clearing her by a
     few feet. We were round after her in an instant, but she was already
     nearly at the bank. It was a wild and desolate place, where the moon
     glimmered upon a wide expanse of marsh-land, with pools of stagnant
     water and beds of decaying vegetation. The launch with a dull thud
     ran up upon the mud-bank, with her bow in the air and her stern flush
     with the water. The fugitive sprang out, but his stump instantly sank
     its whole length into the sodden soil. In vain he struggled and
     writhed. Not one step could he possibly take either forwards or
     backwards. He yelled in impotent rage, and kicked frantically into
     the mud with his other foot, but his struggles only bored his wooden
     pin the deeper into the sticky bank. When we brought our launch
     alongside he was so firmly anchored that it was only by throwing the
     end of a rope over his shoulders that we were able to haul him out,
     and to drag him, like some evil fish, over our side. The two Smiths,
     father and son, sat sullenly in their launch, but came aboard meekly
     enough when commanded. The Aurora herself we hauled off and made fast
     to our stern. A solid iron chest of Indian workmanship stood upon the
     deck. This, there could be no question, was the same that had
     contained the ill-omened treasure of the Sholtos. There was no key,
     but it was of considerable weight, so we transferred it carefully to
     our own little cabin. As we steamed slowly up-stream again, we
     flashed our search-light in every direction, but there was no sign of
     the Islander. Somewhere in the dark ooze at the bottom of the Thames
     lie the bones of that strange visitor to our shores.

     "See here," said Holmes, pointing to the wooden hatchway. "We were
     hardly quick enough with our pistols." There, sure enough, just
     behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts
     which we knew so well. It must have whizzed between us at the instant
     that we fired. Holmes smiled at it and shrugged his shoulders in his
     easy fashion, but I confess that it turned me sick to think of the
     horrible death which had passed so close to us that night.





          CHAPTER XI
          The Great Agra Treasure


     Our captive sat in the cabin opposite to the iron box which he had
     done so much and waited so long to gain. He was a sunburned,
     reckless-eyed fellow, with a net-work of lines and wrinkles all over
     his mahogany features, which told of a hard, open-air life. There was
     a singular prominence about his bearded chin which marked a man who
     was not to be easily turned from his purpose. His age may have been
     fifty or thereabouts, for his black, curly hair was thickly shot with
     gray. His face in repose was not an unpleasing one, though his heavy
     brows and aggressive chin gave him, as I had lately seen, a terrible
     expression when moved to anger. He sat now with his handcuffed hands
     upon his lap, and his head sunk upon his breast, while he looked with
     his keen, twinkling eyes at the box which had been the cause of his
     ill-doings. It seemed to me that there was more sorrow than anger in
     his rigid and contained countenance. Once he looked up at me with a
     gleam of something like humour in his eyes.

     "Well, Jonathan Small," said Holmes, lighting a cigar, "I am sorry
     that it has come to this."

     "And so am I, sir," he answered, frankly. "I don't believe that I can
     swing over the job. I give you my word on the book that I never
     raised hand against Mr. Sholto. It was that little hell-hound Tonga
     who shot one of his cursed darts into him. I had no part in it, sir.
     I was as grieved as if it had been my blood-relation. I welted the
     little devil with the slack end of the rope for it, but it was done,
     and I could not undo it again."

     "Have a cigar," said Holmes; "and you had best take a pull out of my
     flask, for you are very wet. How could you expect so small and weak a
     man as this black fellow to overpower Mr. Sholto and hold him while
     you were climbing the rope?"

     "You seem to know as much about it as if you were there, sir. The
     truth is that I hoped to find the room clear. I knew the habits of
     the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually
     went down to his supper. I shall make no secret of the business. The
     best defence that I can make is just the simple truth. Now, if it had
     been the old major I would have swung for him with a light heart. I
     would have thought no more of knifing him than of smoking this cigar.
     But it's cursed hard that I should be lagged over this young Sholto,
     with whom I had no quarrel whatever."

     "You are under the charge of Mr. Athelney Jones, of Scotland Yard. He
     is going to bring you up to my rooms, and I shall ask you for a true
     account of the matter. You must make a clean breast of it, for if you
     do I hope that I may be of use to you.  I think I can prove that the
     poison acts so quickly that the man was dead before ever you reached
     the room."

     "That he was, sir. I never got such a turn in my life as when I saw
     him grinning at me with his head on his shoulder as I climbed through
     the window. It fairly shook me, sir. I'd have half killed Tonga for
     it if he had not scrambled off. That was how he came to leave his
     club, and some of his darts too, as he tells me, which I dare say
     helped to put you on our track; though how you kept on it is more
     than I can tell. I don't feel no malice against you for it. But it
     does seem a queer thing," he added, with a bitter smile, "that I who
     have a fair claim to nigh upon half a million of money should spend
     the first half of my life building a breakwater in the Andamans, and
     am like to spend the other half digging drains at Dartmoor. It was an
     evil day for me when first I clapped eyes upon the merchant Achmet
     and had to do with the Agra treasure, which never brought anything
     but a curse yet upon the man who owned it. To him it brought murder,
     to Major Sholto it brought fear and guilt, to me it has meant slavery
     for life."

     At this moment Athelney Jones thrust his broad face and heavy
     shoulders into the tiny cabin. "Quite a family party," he remarked.
     "I think I shall have a pull at that flask, Holmes.  Well, I think we
     may all congratulate each other. Pity we didn't take the other alive;
     but there was no choice. I say, Holmes, you must confess that you cut
     it rather fine. It was all we could do to overhaul her."

     "All is well that ends well," said Holmes. "But I certainly did not
     know that the Aurora was such a clipper."

     "Smith says she is one of the fastest launches on the river, and that
     if he had had another man to help him with the engines we should
     never have caught her. He swears he knew nothing of this Norwood
     business."

     "Neither he did," cried our prisoner,--"not a word. I chose his
     launch because I heard that she was a flier. We told him nothing, but
     we paid him well, and he was to get something handsome if we reached
     our vessel, the Esmeralda, at Gravesend, outward bound for the
     Brazils."

     "Well, if he has done no wrong we shall see that no wrong comes to
     him. If we are pretty quick in catching our men, we are not so quick
     in condemning them." It was amusing to notice how the consequential
     Jones was already beginning to give himself airs on the strength of
     the capture. From the slight smile which played over Sherlock
     Holmes's face, I could see that the speech had not been lost upon
     him.

     "We will be at Vauxhall Bridge presently," said Jones, "and shall
     land you, Dr. Watson, with the treasure-box. I need hardly tell you
     that I am taking a very grave responsibility upon myself in doing
     this. It is most irregular; but of course an agreement is an
     agreement. I must, however, as a matter of duty, send an inspector
     with you, since you have so valuable a charge. You will drive, no
     doubt?"

     "Yes, I shall drive."

     "It is a pity there is no key, that we may make an inventory first.
     You will have to break it open. Where is the key, my man?"

     "At the bottom of the river," said Small, shortly.

     "Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have
     had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn
     you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street
     rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station."

     They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,
     genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour's drive
     brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servant seemed surprised at
     so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she
     explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in
     the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving
     the obliging inspector in the cab.

     She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white
     diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and
     waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned
     back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and
     tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant
     hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and
     her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the
     sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright
     flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.

     "I heard a cab drive up," she said. "I thought that Mrs. Forrester
     had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you.
     What news have you brought me?"

     "I have brought something better than news," said I, putting down the
     box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my
     heart was heavy within me. "I have brought you something which is
     worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune."

     She glanced at iron box. "Is that the treasure, then?" she asked,
     coolly enough.

     "Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half
     is Thaddeus Sholto's. You will have a couple of hundred thousand
     each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be
     few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?"

     I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that
     she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her
     eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.

     "If I have it," said she, "I owe it to you."

     "No, no," I answered, "not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
     With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue
     which has taxed even his analytical genius.  As it was, we very
     nearly lost it at the last moment."

     "Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson," said she.

     I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her
     last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora,
     the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and
     the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and
     shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the
     dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I
     feared that she was about to faint.

     "It is nothing," she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.
     "I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed
     my friends in such horrible peril."

     "That is all over," I answered. "It was nothing. I will tell you no
     more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the
     treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it
     with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see
     it."

     "It would be of the greatest interest to me," she said. There was no
     eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that
     it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize
     which had cost so much to win.

     "What a pretty box!" she said, stooping over it. "This is Indian
     work, I suppose?"

     "Yes; it is Benares metal-work."

     "And so heavy!" she exclaimed, trying to raise it. "The box alone
     must be of some value. Where is the key?"

     "Small threw it into the Thames," I answered. "I must borrow Mrs.
     Forrester's poker." There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,
     wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end
     of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open
     with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We
     both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!

     No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch
     thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest
     constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or
     crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and
     completely empty.

     "The treasure is lost," said Miss Morstan, calmly.

     As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great
     shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra
     treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.
     It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize
     nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. "Thank
     God!" I ejaculated from my very heart.

     She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. "Why do you say
     that?" she asked.

     "Because you are within my reach again," I said, taking her hand. She
     did not withdraw it. "Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a
     man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my
     lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is
     why I said, 'Thank God.'"

     "Then I say, 'Thank God,' too," she whispered, as I drew her to my
     side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had
     gained one.





          CHAPTER XII
          The Strange Story of Jonathan Small


     A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary
     time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him
     the empty box.

     "There goes the reward!" said he, gloomily. "Where there is no money
     there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner
     each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there."

     "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man," I said. "He will see that you
     are rewarded, treasure or no."

     The inspector shook his head despondently, however. "It's a bad job,"
     he repeated; "and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think."

     His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank
     enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They
     had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had
     changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon
     the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual
     listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with
     his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty
     box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.

     "Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it," he
     cried, exultantly. "It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot
     I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no
     living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the
     Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have
     the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through
     for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us
     always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have
     done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to
     kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich
     that we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is,
     and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us,
     I put the loot away in a safe place. There are no rupees for you this
     journey."

     "You are deceiving us, Small," said Athelney Jones, sternly. "If you
     had wished to throw the treasure into the Thames it would have been
     easier for you to have thrown box and all."

     "Easier for me to throw, and easier for you to recover," he answered,
     with a shrewd, sidelong look. "The man that was clever enough to hunt
     me down is clever enough to pick an iron box from the bottom of a
     river. Now that they are scattered over five miles or so, it may be a
     harder job. It went to my heart to do it, though. I was half mad when
     you came up with us. However, there's no good grieving over it. I've
     had ups in my life, and I've had downs, but I've learned not to cry
     over spilled milk."

     "This is a very serious matter, Small," said the detective. "If you
     had helped justice, instead of thwarting it in this way, you would
     have had a better chance at your trial."

     "Justice!" snarled the ex-convict. "A pretty justice! Whose loot is
     this, if it is not ours? Where is the justice that I should give it
     up to those who have never earned it? Look how I have earned it!
     Twenty long years in that fever-ridden swamp, all day at work under
     the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts,
     bitten by mosquitoes, racked with ague, bullied by every cursed
     black-faced policeman who loved to take it out of a white man. That
     was how I earned the Agra treasure; and you talk to me of justice
     because I cannot bear to feel that I have paid this price only that
     another may enjoy it! I would rather swing a score of times, or have
     one of Tonga's darts in my hide, than live in a convict's cell and
     feel that another man is at his ease in a palace with the money that
     should be mine." Small had dropped his mask of stoicism, and all this
     came out in a wild whirl of words, while his eyes blazed, and the
     handcuffs clanked together with the impassioned movement of his
     hands. I could understand, as I saw the fury and the passion of the
     man, that it was no groundless or unnatural terror which had
     possessed Major Sholto when he first learned that the injured convict
     was upon his track.

     "You forget that we know nothing of all this," said Holmes quietly.
     "We have not heard your story, and we cannot tell how far justice may
     originally have been on your side."

     "Well, sir, you have been very fair-spoken to me, though I can see
     that I have you to thank that I have these bracelets upon my wrists.
     Still, I bear no grudge for that. It is all fair and above-board. If
     you want to hear my story I have no wish to hold it back. What I say
     to you is God's truth, every word of it. Thank you; you can put the
     glass beside me here, and I'll put my lips to it if I am dry.

     "I am a Worcestershire man myself,--born near Pershore. I dare say
     you would find a heap of Smalls living there now if you were to look.
     I have often thought of taking a look round there, but the truth is
     that I was never much of a credit to the family, and I doubt if they
     would be so very glad to see me. They were all steady, chapel-going
     folk, small farmers, well known and respected over the country-side,
     while I was always a bit of a rover. At last, however, when I was
     about eighteen, I gave them no more trouble, for I got into a mess
     over a girl, and could only get out of it again by taking the queen's
     shilling and joining the 3d Buffs, which was just starting for India.

     "I wasn't destined to do much soldiering, however. I had just got
     past the goose-step, and learned to handle my musket, when I was fool
     enough to go swimming in the Ganges. Luckily for me, my company
     sergeant, John Holder, was in the water at the same time, and he was
     one of the finest swimmers in the service. A crocodile took me, just
     as I was half-way across, and nipped off my right leg as clean as a
     surgeon could have done it, just above the knee. What with the shock
     and the loss of blood, I fainted, and should have drowned if Holder
     had not caught hold of me and paddled for the bank. I was five months
     in hospital over it, and when at last I was able to limp out of it
     with this timber toe strapped to my stump I found myself invalided
     out of the army and unfitted for any active occupation.

     "I was, as you can imagine, pretty down on my luck at this time, for
     I was a useless cripple though not yet in my twentieth year. However,
     my misfortune soon proved to be a blessing in disguise. A man named
     Abelwhite, who had come out there as an indigo-planter, wanted an
     overseer to look after his coolies and keep them up to their work. He
     happened to be a friend of our colonel's, who had taken an interest
     in me since the accident. To make a long story short, the colonel
     recommended me strongly for the post and, as the work was mostly to
     be done on horseback, my leg was no great obstacle, for I had enough
     knee left to keep good grip on the saddle. What I had to do was to
     ride over the plantation, to keep an eye on the men as they worked,
     and to report the idlers. The pay was fair, I had comfortable
     quarters, and altogether I was content to spend the remainder of my
     life in indigo-planting. Mr. Abelwhite was a kind man, and he would
     often drop into my little shanty and smoke a pipe with me, for white
     folk out there feel their hearts warm to each other as they never do
     here at home.

     "Well, I was never in luck's way long. Suddenly, without a note of
     warning, the great mutiny broke upon us. One month India lay as still
     and peaceful, to all appearance, as Surrey or Kent; the next there
     were two hundred thousand black devils let loose, and the country was
     a perfect hell. Of course you know all about it, gentlemen,--a deal
     more than I do, very like, since reading is not in my line. I only
     know what I saw with my own eyes. Our plantation was at a place
     called Muttra, near the border of the Northwest Provinces. Night
     after night the whole sky was alight with the burning bungalows, and
     day after day we had small companies of Europeans passing through our
     estate with their wives and children, on their way to Agra, where
     were the nearest troops. Mr. Abelwhite was an obstinate man. He had
     it in his head that the affair had been exaggerated, and that it
     would blow over as suddenly as it had sprung up. There he sat on his
     veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the
     country was in a blaze about him. Of course we stuck by him, I and
     Dawson, who, with his wife, used to do the book-work and the
     managing. Well, one fine day the crash came. I had been away on a

Iteration: 37000
     "We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the
     Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round
     his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from
     the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him.
     His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the
     greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia,
     which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its
     decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. The
     other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia.
     He has broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his
     track. Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man
     himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the
     fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in
     the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.
     Sherlock Holmes?"

     Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.

     "Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!" he cried. "But I didn't quite
     follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts."

     "The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After
     all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is
     the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am
     gathering all the threads into my hands."

     "And the next stage?"

     "Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
     quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on
     the charge of murder. Will you come with us?"

     "I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can't
     say for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon a
     factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great
     hopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will
     come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the
     heels."

     "In the Italian quarter?"

     "No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him.
     If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I'll promise
     to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be
     done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do
     us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and
     it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You'll dine with
     us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time
     for us to start. In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you
     would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send, and
     it is important that it should go at once."

     Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old
     daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at
     last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said
     nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. For my
     own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had
     traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I could
     not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood clearly
     that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon
     the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick.
     No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act,
     and I could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had
     inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow
     the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not
     surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with
     me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his
     favourite weapon.

     A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
     spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was
     directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed
     with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. In the light
     of a street lamp we read "Laburnum Villa" upon the gate-post of one
     of them. The occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was
     dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single
     blurred circle on to the garden path. The wooden fence which
     separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon
     the inner side, and here it was that we crouched.

     "I fear that you'll have a long wait," Holmes whispered. "We may
     thank our stars that it is not raining. I don't think we can even
     venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it's a two to one chance
     that we get something to pay us for our trouble."

     It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes
     had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular
     fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his
     coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as
     swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it
     whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against
     the black shadow of the house. There was a long pause, during which
     we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our
     ears. The window was being opened. The noise ceased, and again there
     was a long silence. The fellow was making his way into the house. We
     saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he
     sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through
     another blind, and then through another.

     "Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,"
     Lestrade whispered.

     But before we could move the man had emerged again. As he came out
     into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried something
     white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round him. The silence
     of the deserted street reassured him. Turning his back upon us he
     laid down his burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a
     sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. The man was so intent
     upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole
     across the grass plot. With the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his
     back, and an instant later Lestrade and I had him by either wrist and
     the handcuffs had been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a
     hideous, sallow face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at
     us, and I knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we
     had secured.

     But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention.
     Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining
     that which the man had brought from the house. It was a bust of
     Napoleon like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been
     broken into similar fragments. Carefully Holmes held each separate
     shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from any other
     shattered piece of plaster. He had just completed his examination
     when the hall lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the
     house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented
     himself.

     "Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?" said Holmes.

     "Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the note
     which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly what you
     told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited developments.
     Well, I'm very glad to see that you have got the rascal. I hope,
     gentlemen, that you will come in and have some refreshment."

     However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so
     within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four
     upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say; but he
     glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my
     hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We
     stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a search of
     his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath
     knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.

     "That's all right," said Lestrade, as we parted. "Hill knows all
     these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You'll find that my
     theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I'm sure I am
     exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in
     which you laid hands upon him. I don't quite understand it all yet."

     "I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations," said Holmes.
     "Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off,
     and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very
     end. If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o'clock
     to-morrow I think I shall be able to show you that even now you have
     not grasped the entire meaning of this business, which presents some
     features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime.
     If ever I permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems,
     Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of
     the singular adventure of the Napoleonic busts."

     When we met again next evening Lestrade was furnished with much
     information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was
     Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne'er-do-well among
     the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and had
     earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and had
     twice already been in jail--once for a petty theft and once, as we
     had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk
     English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the busts were
     still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon the
     subject; but the police had discovered that these same busts might
     very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in
     this class of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. To all this
     information, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with
     polite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see that
     his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of mingled
     uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to
     assume. At last he started in his chair and his eyes brightened.
     There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we heard steps upon
     the stairs, and an elderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers
     was ushered in. In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned
     carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.

     "Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?"

     My friend bowed and smiled. "Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I suppose?"
     said he.

     "Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late; but the trains were
     awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession."

     "Exactly."

     "I have your letter here. You said, 'I desire to possess a copy of
     Devine's Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one
     which is in your possession.' Is that right?"

     "Certainly."

     "I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine
     how you knew that I owned such a thing."

     "Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very
     simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you
     their last copy, and he gave me your address."

     "Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?"

     "No, he did not."

     "Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only gave
     fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that
     before I take ten pounds from you."

     "I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have
     named that price, so I intend to stick to it."

     "Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust up
     with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!" He opened his bag, and
     at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust
     that he was talking."

     "I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have
     named that price, so I intend to stick to it."

     "Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust up
     with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!" He opened his bag, and
     at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust
     which we had already seen more than once in fragments.

     Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon
     the table.

     "You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence of
     these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every possible
     right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a methodical man, you
     see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. Thank
     you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good
     evening."

     When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes's movements were
     such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean white
     cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he placed his
     newly-acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. Finally, he picked up
     his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the
     head. The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over
     the shattered remains. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he
     held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a
     plum in a pudding.

     "Gentlemen," he cried, "let me introduce you to the famous black
     pearl of the Borgias."

     Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous
     impulse, we both broke out clapping as at the well-wrought crisis of
     a play. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes's pale cheeks, and he
     bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his
     audience. It was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be
     a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human love for admiration and
     applause. The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned
     away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved
     to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.

     "Yes, gentlemen," said he, "it is the most famous pearl now existing
     in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain
     of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna's
     bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of
     this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured
     by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You will remember, Lestrade, the
     sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel, and the
     vain efforts of the London police to recover it. I was myself
     consulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw any light upon it.
     Suspicion fell upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and
     it was proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to
     trace any connection between them. The maid's name was Lucretia
     Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was
     murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the
     dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the
     disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of
     Beppo for some crime of violence, an event which took place in the
     factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were
     being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you
     see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they
     presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He
     may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's
     confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his
     sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.

     "The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment, when it
     was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made for the
     factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few
     minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which
     would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six plaster
     casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them was still
     soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in
     the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered
     over the aperture once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one
     could possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year's
     imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over
     London. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by
     breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him nothing, for
     as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to
     it--as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted
     his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a
     cousin who works with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had
     bought the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson,
     and in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.
     Then, with the help of some Italian employe, he succeeded in finding
     out where the other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker's.
     There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible
     for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which
     followed."

     "If he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph?" I
     asked.

     "As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any
     third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after the murder I
     calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his
     movements. He would fear that the police would read his secret, and
     so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him. Of course, I
     could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker's bust. I had
     not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl; but it was
     evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the
     bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which
     had a lamp overlooking it. Since Harker's bust was one in three the
     chances were exactly as I told you, two to one against the pearl
     being inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he
     would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the house,
     so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down with the happiest
     results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the
     Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man linked
     the one event with the other. There only remained a single bust--the
     Reading one--and the pearl must be there. I bought it in your
     presence from the owner--and there it lies."

     We sat in silence for a moment.

     "Well," said Lestrade, "I've seen you handle a good many cases, Mr.
     Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than
     that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very
     proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there's not a man, from
     the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad
     to shake you by the hand."

     "Thank you!" said Holmes. "Thank you!" and as he turned away it
     seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human
     emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold and
     practical thinker once more. "Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,"
     said he, "and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case.
     Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes your way I shall be
     happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution."






                       THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS

     It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I
     need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some
     weeks in one of our great University towns, and it was during this
     time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to
     relate befell us. It will be obvious that any details which would
     help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would
     be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scandal may well be
     allowed to die out. With due discretion the incident itself may,
     however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those
     qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour in my
     statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to
     any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.

     We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library
     where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early
     English charters--researches which led to results so striking that
     they may be the subject of one of my future narratives. Here it was
     that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton
     Soames, tutor and lecturer at the College of St. Luke's. Mr. Soames
     was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had
     always known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular
     occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it
     was clear something very unusual had occurred.

     "I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your
     valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke's, and
     really, but for the happy chance of your being in the town, I should
     have been at a loss what to do."

     "I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions," my friend
     answered. "I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the
     police."

     "No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. When once
     the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of
     those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most
     essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known as your
     powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me. I beg
     you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can."

     My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the
     congenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without his scrap-books, his
     chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man. He
     shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor
     in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth
     his story.

     "I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day
     of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am one of the
     examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists
     of a large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not
     seen. This passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would
     naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it
     in advance. For this reason great care is taken to keep the paper
     secret.

     "To-day about three o'clock the proofs of this paper arrived from the
     printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides. I
     had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely
     correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed. I had,
     however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the
     proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an hour.

     "You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double--a
     green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I approached
     my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I
     imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I
     found that it was all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far
     as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man
     who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is
     absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that
     he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very
     carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my
     room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His
     forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other
     occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable
     consequences.

     "The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had
     rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had
     left them all together. Now, I found that one of them was lying on
     the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third
     was where I had left it."

     Holmes stirred for the first time.

     "The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third
     where you left it," said he.

     "Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possibly know
     that?"

     "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

     "For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable
     liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however, with the
     utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the
     truth. The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key
     in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the
     papers. A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a
     very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk
     in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.

     "Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had nearly fainted
     when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with. I
     gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I
     made a most careful examination of the room. I soon saw that the
     intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled
     papers. On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil
     which had been sharpened. A broken tip of lead was lying there also.
     Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had
     broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to
     it."

     "Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his
     attention became more engrossed by the case. "Fortune has been your
     friend."

     "This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of
     red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was
     smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about three
     inches long--not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. Not only this,
     but on the table I found a small ball of black dough, or clay, with
     specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. I am convinced
     that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. There
     were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. I was at
     my wits' ends, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that
     you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter
     into your hands. Do help me, Mr. Holmes! You see my dilemma. Either I
     must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until
     fresh papers are prepared, and since this cannot be done without
     explanation there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a
     cloud not only on the college, but on the University. Above all
     things I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly."

     "I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as I
     can," said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat. "The case is
     not entirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited you in your room
     after the papers came to you?"


Iteration: 38000
     "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"

     "I do not know what to believe."

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

     "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     admit that the footmark is material."

     "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out,
     and yet he was diabolical as well."

     "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But
     now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have
     you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it
     is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me
     to do it."

     "I did not say that I desired you to do it."

     "Then, how can I assist you?"

     "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville,
     who arrives at Waterloo Station"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his
     watch--"in exactly one hour and a quarter."

     "He being the heir?"

     "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
     gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the
     accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
     way. I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of
     Sir Charles's will."

     "There is no other claimant, I presume?"

     "None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was
     Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir
     Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the
     father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of
     the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was
     the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He
     made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died
     there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
     In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have
     had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr.
     Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"

     "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"

     "It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
     Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that
     if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would
     have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and
     the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be
     denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side
     depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by
     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
     Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious
     interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you
     and ask for your advice."

     Holmes considered for a little time.

     "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your opinion
     there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for
     a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"

     "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
     that this may be so."

     "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
     could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A
     devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too
     inconceivable a thing."

     "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would
     probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
     things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man
     will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty
     minutes. What would you recommend?"

     "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
     scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir
     Henry Baskerville."

     "And then?"

     "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my
     mind about the matter."

     "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"

     "Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
     much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of
     help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry
     Baskerville with you."

     "I will do so, Mr. Holmes." He scribbled the appointment on his
     shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
     fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

     "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir
     Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon
     the moor?"

     "Three people did."

     "Did any see it after?"

     "I have not heard of any."

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
     satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

     "Going out, Watson?"

     "Unless I can help you."

     "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you
     for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of
     view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound
     of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you
     could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should
     be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting
     problem which has been submitted to us this morning."

     I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
     in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he
     weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories,
     balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which
     points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day
     at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was
     nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once
     more.

     My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken
     out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp
     upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears
     were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco
     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I
     had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an
     armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of
     paper lay around him.

     "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.

     "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."

     "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."

     "Thick! It is intolerable."

     "Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
     perceive."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "Am I right?"

     "Certainly, but how?"

     He laughed at my bewildered expression.

     "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a
     pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your
     expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
     immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
     boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with
     intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
     obvious?"

     "Well, it is rather obvious."

     "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
     observes. Where do you think that I have been?"

     "A fixture also."

     "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."

     "In spirit?"

     "Exactly. My body has remained in this arm-chair and has, I regret to
     observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
     incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
     Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my
     spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could
     find my way about."

     "A large scale map, I presume?"

     "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
     "Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is
     Baskerville Hall in the middle."

     "With a wood round it?"

     "Exactly. I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name,
     must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon
     the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of
     Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a
     radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered
     dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative.
     There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
     naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are
     two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles
     away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these
     scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is
     the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may
     help to play it again."

     "It must be a wild place."

     "Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
     hand in the affairs of men--"

     "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."

     "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There
     are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether
     any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime
     and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should
     be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws
     of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to
     exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I
     think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. It is a
     singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a
     concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of
     getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my
     convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"

     "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."

     "What do you make of it?"

     "It is very bewildering."

     "It has certainly a character of its own. There are points of
     distinction about it. That change in the footprints, for example.
     What do you make of that?"

     "Mortimer said that the man had walked on tiptoe down that portion of
     the alley."

     "He only repeated what some fool had said at the inquest. Why should
     a man walk on tiptoe down the alley?"

     "What then?"

     "He was running, Watson--running desperately, running for his life,
     running until he burst his heart and fell dead upon his face."

     "Running from what?"

     "There lies our problem. There are indications that the man was
     crazed with fear before ever he began to run."

     "How can you say that?"

     "I am presuming that the cause of his fears came to him across the
     moor. If that were so, and it seems most probable, only a man who had
     lost his wits would have run from the house instead of towards it. If
     the gipsy's evidence may be taken as true, he ran with cries for help
     in the direction where help was least likely to be. Then, again, whom
     was he waiting for that night, and why was he waiting for him in the
     Yew Alley rather than in his own house?"

     "You think that he was waiting for someone?"

     "The man was elderly and infirm. We can understand his taking an
     evening stroll, but the ground was damp and the night inclement. Is
     it natural that he should stand for five or ten minutes, as Dr.
     Mortimer, with more practical sense than I should have given him
     credit for, deduced from the cigar ash?"

     "But he went out every evening."

     "I think it unlikely that he waited at the moor-gate every evening.
     On the contrary, the evidence is that he avoided the moor. That night
     he waited there. It was the night before he made his departure for
     London. The thing takes shape, Watson. It becomes coherent. Might I
     ask you to hand me my violin, and we will postpone all further
     thought upon this business until we have had the advantage of meeting
     Dr. Mortimer and Sir Henry Baskerville in the morning."





          CHAPTER IV
          Sir Henry Baskerville


     Our breakfast-table was cleared early, and Holmes waited in his
     dressing-gown for the promised interview. Our clients were punctual
     to their appointment, for the clock had just struck ten when Dr.
     Mortimer was shown up, followed by the young baronet. The latter was
     a small, alert, dark-eyed man about thirty years of age, very
     sturdily built, with thick black eyebrows and a strong, pugnacious
     face. He wore a ruddy-tinted tweed suit and had the weather-beaten
     appearance of one who has spent most of his time in the open air, and
     yet there was something in his steady eye and the quiet assurance of
     his bearing which indicated the gentleman.

     "This is Sir Henry Baskerville," said Dr. Mortimer.

     "Why, yes," said he, "and the strange thing is, Mr. Sherlock Holmes,
     that if my friend here had not proposed coming round to you this
     morning I should have come on my own account. I understand that you
     think out little puzzles, and I've had one this morning which wants
     more thinking out than I am able to give it."

     "Pray take a seat, Sir Henry. Do I understand you to say that you
     have yourself had some remarkable experience since you arrived in
     London?"

     "Nothing of much importance, Mr. Holmes. Only a joke, as like as not.
     It was this letter, if you can call it a letter, which reached me
     this morning."

     He laid an envelope upon the table, and we all bent over it. It was
     of common quality, grayish in colour. The address, "Sir Henry
     Baskerville, Northumberland Hotel," was printed in rough characters;
     the postmark "Charing Cross," and the date of posting the preceding
     evening.

     "Who knew that you were going to the Northumberland Hotel?" asked
     Holmes, glancing keenly across at our visitor.

     "No one could have known. We only decided after I met Dr. Mortimer."

     "But Dr. Mortimer was no doubt already stopping there?"

     "No, I had been staying with a friend," said the doctor. "There was
     no possible indication that we intended to go to this hotel."

     "Hum! Someone seems to be very deeply interested in your movements."
     Out of the envelope he took a half-sheet of foolscap paper folded
     into four. This he opened and spread flat upon the table. Across the
     middle of it a single sentence had been formed by the expedient of
     pasting printed words upon it. It ran:

     As you value your life or your reason keep away from the moor.

     The word "moor" only was printed in ink.

     "Now," said Sir Henry Baskerville, "perhaps you will tell me, Mr.
     Holmes, what in thunder is the meaning of that, and who it is that
     takes so much interest in my affairs?"

     "What do you make of it, Dr. Mortimer? You must allow that there is
     nothing supernatural about this, at any rate?"

     "No, sir, but it might very well come from someone who was convinced
     that the business is supernatural."

     "What business?" asked Sir Henry sharply. "It seems to me that all
     you gentlemen know a great deal more than I do about my own affairs."

     "You shall share our knowledge before you leave this room, Sir Henry.
     I promise you that," said Sherlock Holmes. "We will confine ourselves
     for the present with your permission to this very interesting
     document, which must have been put together and posted yesterday
     evening. Have you yesterday's Times, Watson?"

     "It is here in the corner."

     "Might I trouble you for it--the inside page, please, with the
     leading articles?" He glanced swiftly over it, running his eyes up
     and down the columns. "Capital article this on free trade. Permit me
     to give you an extract from it.

     "'You may be cajoled into imagining that your own special trade or
     your own industry will be encouraged by a protective tariff, but it
     stands to reason that such legislation must in the long run keep away
     wealth from the country, diminish the value of our imports, and lower
     the general conditions of life in this island.'

     "What do you think of that, Watson?" cried Holmes in high glee,
     rubbing his hands together with satisfaction. "Don't you think that
     is an admirable sentiment?"

     Dr. Mortimer looked at Holmes with an air of professional interest,
     and Sir Henry Baskerville turned a pair of puzzled dark eyes upon me.

     "I don't know much about the tariff and things of that kind," said
     he; "but it seems to me we've got a bit off the trail so far as that
     note is concerned."

     "On the contrary, I think we are particularly hot upon the trail, Sir
     Henry. Watson here knows more about my methods than you do, but I
     fear that even he has not quite grasped the significance of this
     sentence."

     "No, I confess that I see no connection."

     "And yet, my dear Watson, there is so very close a connection that
     the one is extracted out of the other. 'You,' 'your,' 'your,' 'life,'
     'reason,' 'value,' 'keep away,' 'from the.' Don't you see now whence
     these words have been taken?"

     "By thunder, you're right! Well, if that isn't smart!" cried Sir
     Henry.

     "If any possible doubt remained it is settled by the fact that 'keep
     the case, although what his conclusions were was more than I could
     rough characters. But the Times is a paper which is seldom found in
     any hands but those of the highly educated. We may take it,
     therefore, that the letter was composed by an educated man who wished
     to pose as an uneducated one, and his effort to conceal his own
     writing suggests that that writing might be known, or come to be
     known, by you. Again, you will observe that the words are not gummed
     on in an accurate line, but that some are much higher than others.
     'Life,' for example is quite out of its proper place. That may point
     to carelessness or it may point to agitation and hurry upon the part
     of the cutter. On the whole I incline to the latter view, since the
     matter was evidently important, and it is unlikely that the composer
     of such a letter would be careless. If he were in a hurry it opens up
     the interesting question why he should be in a hurry, since any
     letter posted up to early morning would reach Sir Henry before he
     would leave his hotel. Did the composer fear an interruption--and
     from whom?"

     "We are coming now rather into the region of guesswork," said Dr.
     Mortimer.

     "Say, rather, into the region where we balance probabilities and
     choose the most likely. It is the scientific use of the imagination,
     but we have always some material basis on which to start our
     speculation. Now, you would call it a guess, no doubt, but I am
     almost certain that this address has been written in a hotel."

     "How in the world can you say that?"

     "If you examine it carefully you will see that both the pen and the
     ink have given the writer trouble. The pen has spluttered twice in a
     single word, and has run dry three times in a short address, showing
     that there was very little ink in the bottle. Now, a private pen or
     ink-bottle is seldom allowed to be in such a state, and the
     combination of the two must be quite rare. But you know the hotel ink
     and the hotel pen, where it is rare to get anything else. Yes, I have

     During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad
     hope for any upon so dry a day. Your servant seems to have quite
     at us and at the smouldering fire. It was an odious face--crafty,
     throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier
     and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me,
     knocked, but received no answer. Perceiving a light in the front room
     finding him proof against every threat, they had hurled him back into
     him--you must save him! I tell you that you must save him!" The Duke
     had dropped the last attempt at self-command, and was pacing the room
     with a convulsed face and with his clenched hands raving in the air.
     is all that is left to me."

     "I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day
     of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am one of the
     examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists
     of a large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not
     seen. This passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would
     naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it
     in advance. For this reason great care is taken to keep the paper
     secret.

     "To-day about three o'clock the proofs of this paper arrived from the
     Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your
     had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely
     correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed. I had,
     however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the
     proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an hour.

     "You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double--a
     green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I approached
     my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I
     imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I
     found that it was all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far
     as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man
     who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is
     absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that
     he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very
     carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my
     room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His
     forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other
     Victorian epoch in the West End of London. Next door there appeared
     check which he had met.

     Mrs. Hudson had appeared with a lady's card upon her salver. Holmes
     rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had
     left them all together. Now, I found that one of them was lying on
     the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third
     was where I had left it."

     Holmes stirred for the first time.

     "Mr. Holmes, I implore you not to tell him that I came here." Holmes
     where you left it," said he.

                              John H. Watson, M.D.,
                      late of the Army Medical Department.)





          CHAPTER I
          Mr. Sherlock Holmes


     In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
     University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the
     course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my
     studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland
     Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India
     at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had
     broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had
     advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's
     country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in
     the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in
     safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new
     duties.

     The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
     nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade
     and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal
     battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail
     bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I
     should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not
     been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who
     threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to
     the British lines.

     Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
     undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to
     the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already
     improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to
     bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric
     fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was
     despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became
     convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board
     determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to
     England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and
     landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health
     irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government
     to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.

     I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as
     air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day
     will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally
     gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers
     and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for
     some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless,
     meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably
     more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances
     become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis
     and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a
     complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter
     alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to
     take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive
     domicile.

     On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at
     the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and
     turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser
     under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great
     wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In
     old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now
     I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be
     delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to
     lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a
     hansom.

     "Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in
     undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.
     "You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut."

     I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded
     it by the time that we reached our destination.

     "Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my
     misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"

     "Looking for lodgings," I answered. "Trying to solve the problem as
     to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable
     price."

     "That's a strange thing," remarked my companion; "you are the second
     man to-day that has used that expression to me."

     "And who was the first?" I asked.

     "A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the
     hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not
     get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had
     found, and which were too much for his purse."

     "By Jove!" I cried, "if he really wants someone to share the rooms
     and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a
     partner to being alone."

     Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.
     "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not
     care for him as a constant companion."

     "Why, what is there against him?"

     "Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little
     queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far
     as I know he is a decent fellow enough."

     "A medical student, I suppose?" said I.

     "No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is
     well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I
     know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His
     studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of
     out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors."

     "Did you never ask him what he was going in for?" I asked.

     "No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
     communicative enough when the fancy seizes him."

     "I should like to meet him," I said. "If I am to lodge with anyone, I
     should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong
     enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in
     Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How
     could I meet this friend of yours?"

     "He is sure to be at the laboratory," returned my companion. "He
     either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from
     morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after
     luncheon."

     "Certainly," I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other
     channels.

     As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn,
     Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I
     proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.

     "You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him," he said; "I know
     nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally
     in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not
     hold me responsible."

     "If we don't get on it will be easy to part company," I answered. "It
     seems to me, Stamford," I added, looking hard at my companion, "that
     you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this
     fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed
     about it."

     "It is not easy to express the inexpressible," he answered with a
     laugh. "Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it
     approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a
     little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of
     malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in
     order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I
     think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He
     appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge."

     "Very right too."

     "Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the
     subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking
     rather a bizarre shape."

     "Beating the subjects!"

     "Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw
     him at it with my own eyes."

     "And yet you say he is not a medical student?"

     "No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we
     are, and you must form your own impressions about him." As he spoke,
     we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door,
     which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar
     ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone
     staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of
     whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low
     arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical
     laboratory.

     This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.
     Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,
     test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering
     flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over
     a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he
     glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. "I've
     found it! I've found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards
     us with a test-tube in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is
     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else." Had he discovered
     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.

     "Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Stamford, introducing us.

     "How are you?" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength
     for which I should hardly have given him credit. "You have been in
     Afghanistan, I perceive."

     "How on earth did you know that?" I asked in astonishment.

     "Never mind," said he, chuckling to himself. "The question now is
     about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this
     discovery of mine?"

     "It is interesting, chemically, no doubt," I answered, "but
     practically--"

     "Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
     Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.
     Come over here now!" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his
     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been
     working. "Let us have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long
     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood
     in a chemical pipette. "Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a
     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the
     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than
     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to
     obtain the characteristic reaction." As he spoke, he threw into the
     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a
     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany
     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the
     glass jar.

     "Ha! ha!" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a
     child with a new toy. "What do you think of that?"

     "It seems to be a very delicate test," I remarked.

     "Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and
     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.
     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this
     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test
     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who
     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes."

     "Indeed!" I murmured.

     "Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
     suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His
     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon
     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit
     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many
     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have
     the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any
     difficulty."

     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his
     heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his
     imagination.

     "You are to be congratulated," I remarked, considerably surprised at
     his enthusiasm.

     "There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would
     certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there
     was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of
     Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases
     in which it would have been decisive."

     "You seem to be a walking calendar of crime," said Stamford with a
     laugh. "You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police
     News of the Past.'"

     "Very interesting reading it might be made, too," remarked Sherlock
     Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his
     finger. "I have to be careful," he continued, turning to me with a
     smile, "for I dabble with poisons a good deal." He held out his hand
     as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar
     pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.

     "We came here on business," said Stamford, sitting down on a high
     three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his
     foot. "My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were
     complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I
     thought that I had better bring you together."

     Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms
     with me. "I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street," he said, "which
     would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong
     tobacco, I hope?"

     "I always smoke 'ship's' myself," I answered.

     "That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and
     occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?"

     "By no means."

     "Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at
     times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I
     am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right.
     What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to
     know the worst of one another before they begin to live together."

     I laughed at this cross-examination. "I keep a bull pup," I said,
     "and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at
     all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another
     set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at
     present."

     "Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?" he asked,
     anxiously.

     "It depends on the player," I answered. "A well-played violin is a
     treat for the gods--a badly-played one--"

     "Oh, that's all right," he cried, with a merry laugh. "I think we may
     consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to
     you."

     "When shall we see them?"

     "Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle
     everything," he answered.

     "All right--noon exactly," said I, shaking his hand.

     We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together
     towards my hotel.

     "By the way," I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,
     "how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?"

     My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. "That's just his little
     peculiarity," he said. "A good many people have wanted to know how he
     finds things out."

     "Oh! a mystery is it?" I cried, rubbing my hands. "This is very
     piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The
     proper study of mankind is man,' you know."

     "You must study him, then," Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.
     "You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more
     about you than you about him. Good-bye."

     "Good-bye," I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
     interested in my new acquaintance.





          CHAPTER II
          The Science Of Deduction


     We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.
     221b, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They
     consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large
     airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad
     windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so
     moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain
     was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.
     That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the
     following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and
     portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking
     and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we
     gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our
     new surroundings.

     Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet
     in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be
     up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out

Iteration: 40000
     "What did he do?"

     "He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin
     when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the
     great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will
     find some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse
     me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides."

     A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant
     Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit
     of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire,
     and my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft
     to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes
     and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge
     moth himself. I was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of
     admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should
     lose his footing in the treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of
     steps, and turning round found a woman near me upon the path. She had
     come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the
     position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until
     she was quite close.

     I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been
     told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I
     remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty.
     The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most
     uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast between
     brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair
     and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have
     seen in England--slim, elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut
     face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for
     the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her
     perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange
     apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother
     as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised
     my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark, when her own
     words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.

     "You may imagine, Mr. Holmes, that to me, destitute as I was, such an
     "Queer spot to choose, is it not?" said he as if in answer to my
     position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in
     Watson, for I very much prefer having a witness, if only as a check
     trusty committee, Mr. Chairman--yourself, if I might suggest it, and
     nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once
     solid bone and muscle, who spanned the doorway with his broad
     remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty.

     An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face,
     saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a
     behind where we had been standing, stuck one of those murderous darts





          CHAPTER VI
          A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.


     I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day
     detaching his mind at will. For two hours the strange business in
     which we had been involved appeared to be forgotten, and he was
     entirely absorbed in the pictures of the modern Belgian masters. He
     would talk of nothing but art, of which he had the crudest ideas,
     from our leaving the gallery until we found ourselves at the
     Northumberland Hotel.

     "My dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes:

     the house pretty well, and it was the time when Mr. Sholto usually

     Holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his
     fingers, and frowning, as he stared into the fire.

     associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things

          Mr. Sherlock Holmes


     In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
     University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the
     course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my
     studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland
     Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India
     at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had
     broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had
     advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's
     country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in
     the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in
     safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new
     duties.

     The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
     nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade
     and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal
     battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail
     bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I
     should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not
     been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who
     threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to
     the British lines.

     Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
     undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to
     the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already
     improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to
     bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric
     fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was
     despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became
     convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board
     determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to
     England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and
     landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health
     irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government
     to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.

     I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as
     air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day
     will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally
     gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers
     and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for
     some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless,
     meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably
     more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances
     become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis
     and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a
     complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter
     alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to
     take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive
     domicile.

     On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at
     the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and
     turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser
     under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great
     wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In
     old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now
     I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be
     delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to
     lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a
     hansom.

     "Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in
     undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.
     "You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut."

     I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded
     it by the time that we reached our destination.

     "Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my
     misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"

     "Looking for lodgings," I answered. "Trying to solve the problem as
     to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable
     price."

     "That's a strange thing," remarked my companion; "you are the second
     man to-day that has used that expression to me."

     "And who was the first?" I asked.

     "A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the
     hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not
     get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had
     found, and which were too much for his purse."

     "By Jove!" I cried, "if he really wants someone to share the rooms
     and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a
     partner to being alone."

     Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.
     "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not
     care for him as a constant companion."

     "Why, what is there against him?"

     "Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little
     queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far
     as I know he is a decent fellow enough."

     "A medical student, I suppose?" said I.

     "No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is
     well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I
     know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His
     studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of
     out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors."

     "Did you never ask him what he was going in for?" I asked.

     "No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
     communicative enough when the fancy seizes him."

     "I should like to meet him," I said. "If I am to lodge with anyone, I
     should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong
     enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in
     Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How
     could I meet this friend of yours?"

     "He is sure to be at the laboratory," returned my companion. "He
     either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from
     morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after
     luncheon."

     "Certainly," I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other
     channels.

     As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn,
     Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I
     proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.

     "You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him," he said; "I know
     nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally
     in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not
     hold me responsible."

     "If we don't get on it will be easy to part company," I answered. "It
     seems to me, Stamford," I added, looking hard at my companion, "that
     you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this
     fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed
     about it."

     "It is not easy to express the inexpressible," he answered with a
     laugh. "Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it
     approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a
     little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of
     malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in
     order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I
     think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He
     appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge."

     "Very right too."

     "Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the
     subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking
     rather a bizarre shape."

     "Beating the subjects!"

     "Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw
     him at it with my own eyes."

     "And yet you say he is not a medical student?"

     "No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we
     are, and you must form your own impressions about him." As he spoke,
     we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door,
     which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar
     ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone
     staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of
     whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low
     arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical
     laboratory.

     This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.
     Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,
     test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering
     flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over
     a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he
     glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. "I've
     found it! I've found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards
     us with a test-tube in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is
     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else." Had he discovered
     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.

     "Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Stamford, introducing us.

     "How are you?" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength
     for which I should hardly have given him credit. "You have been in
     Afghanistan, I perceive."

     "How on earth did you know that?" I asked in astonishment.

     "Never mind," said he, chuckling to himself. "The question now is
     about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this
     discovery of mine?"

     "It is interesting, chemically, no doubt," I answered, "but
     practically--"

     "Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
     Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.
     Come over here now!" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his
     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been
     working. "Let us have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long
     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood
     in a chemical pipette. "Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a
     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the
     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than
     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to
     obtain the characteristic reaction." As he spoke, he threw into the
     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a
     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany
     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the
     glass jar.

     "Ha! ha!" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a
     child with a new toy. "What do you think of that?"

     "It seems to be a very delicate test," I remarked.

     "Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and
     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.
     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this
     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test
     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who
     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes."

     "Indeed!" I murmured.

     "Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
     suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His
     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon
     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit
     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many
     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have
     the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any
     difficulty."

     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his
     heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his
     imagination.

     "You are to be congratulated," I remarked, considerably surprised at
     his enthusiasm.

     "Very curious, and the story that hangs round it will strike you as
     being more curious still."

     "These relics have a history then?"

     "And how did you get your clue?"

     "Exactly."

     "The man's death is a mere incident--a trivial episode--in comparison
     with our real task, which is to trace this document and save a
     European catastrophe. Only one important thing has happened in the
     last three days, and that is that nothing has happened. I get reports
     almost hourly from the Government, and it is certain that nowhere in
     Europe is there any sign of trouble. Now, if this letter were
     loose--no, it can't be loose--but if it isn't loose, where can it be?
     helpless children, and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move
     have been court-martialled and shot as likely as not; for people were
     practice has made it second nature to me. I saw the heavy footmarks
     of the constables, but I saw also the track of the two men who had
     first passed through the garden. It was easy to tell that they had

     "Thirty feet each way."

     "No," said he, "I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife
     brought it up to me."

     "Did you answer it yourself?"

     "No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it."

     In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.

     "I could not quite understand the object of your questions this
     was to do the courting. She recognised the drunken brute that he was,
     previous experience--should deliberately break into a house at a time
     tobacco, I hope?"




















          CHAPTER I
          The Singular Experience of Mr. John Scott Eccles


     I find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day
     towards the end of March in the year 1892.  Holmes had received a
     telegram while we sat at our lunch, and he had scribbled a reply.  He
     made no remark, but the matter remained in his thoughts, for he stood
     in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face, smoking his
     these accomplishments, and discovering a calling which needs them
     that there was no possible escape. But he had not that supreme gift
     veranda, drinking whiskey-pegs and smoking cheroots, while the
     sitting-room, hardly uttering a word or moving a muscle from morning
     whether you are with us, or if we must look upon you as an enemy.'

     "'I am with you heart and soul,' said I.

     "'It is well,' he answered, handing me back my firelock. 'You see
     that we trust you, for your word, like ours, is not to be broken. We
     have now only to wait for my brother and the merchant.'

     "'Does your brother know, then, of what you will do?' I asked.

     "So it is. Stop, driver, stop!" We were still a hundred yards or so
     from it, but he insisted upon our alighting, and we finished our
     journey upon foot.

     This conversation had occurred while our cab had been threading its
     way through a long succession of dingy streets and dreary by-ways. In
     We picked our way among groups of dirty children, and through lines

Iteration: 41000
     "'"You're not going away in any kind of spirit, Hudson, I hope," said
     my father, with a tameness which mad my blood boil.

     "'"I've not had my 'pology," said he sulkily, glancing in my
     direction.

     "'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow
     rather roughly," said the dad, turning to me.

     "'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary
     patience towards him," I answered.

     "'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarls. "Very good, mate. We'll see about
     that!"

     "'He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the
     house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night
     after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was
     recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.'

     "'And how?' I asked eagerly.

     "'In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father
     yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father
     read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round
     the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his
     senses. When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and
     eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a
     stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once. We put him to bed; but the
     paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning
     consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.'

     "'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried. 'What then could have been in
     this letter to cause so dreadful a result?'

     "'Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was
     absurd and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!'

     "As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the
     fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we
     dashed up to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a
     gentleman in black emerged from it.

     "'When did it happen, doctor?' asked Trevor.

     "'Almost immediately after you left.'

     "'Did he recover consciousness?'

     "'For an instant before the end.'

     "'Any message for me?'

     "'Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese
     cabinet.'

     "My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I
     remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my
     head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was
     the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how
     had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?  Why,
     too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon
     his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingham? 
     Then I remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr.
     Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to
     blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The
     letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that
     he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it
     might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a
     betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how
     could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? 
     He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those
     ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean
     another. I must see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in
     it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat
     pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought
     in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but
     composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his
     grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the
     table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a
     single sheet of gray paper. 'The supply of game for London is going
     steadily up,' it ran. 'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now
     told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
     hen-pheasant's life.'

     "I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when
     first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was
     evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried
     in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a
     prearranged significance to such phrases as 'fly-paper' and
     'hen-pheasant'?  Such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be
     deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the
     case, and the presence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the
     subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from
     Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the
     combination 'life pheasant's hen' was not encouraging. Then I tried
     alternate words, but neither 'the of for' nor 'supply game London'
     promised to throw any light upon it.

     "And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I
     saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a
     message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.

     "It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my
     companion:

     "'The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.'

     "Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands, 'It must be
     that, I suppose,' said he. "This is worse than death, for it means
     disgrace as well. But what is the meaning of these "head-keepers" and
     "hen-pheasants"?

     "'It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to
     us if we had no other means of discovering the sender. You see that
     he has begun by writing "The ... game ... is," and so on. Afterwards
     he had, to fulfill the prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words
     in each space. He would naturally use the first words which came to
     his mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among
     them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or
     interested in breeding. Do you know anything of this Beddoes?'

     "'Why, now that you mention it,' said he, 'I remember that my poor
     father used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his
     preserves every autumn.'

     "'Then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes,' said I. 'It
     only remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor
     Hudson seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and
     respected men.'

     "'Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and shame!' cried my
     friend. 'But from you I shall have no secrets. Here is the statement
     which was drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from
     Hudson had become imminent. I found it in the Japanese cabinet, as he
     told the doctor. Take it and read it to me, for I have neither the
     strength nor the courage to do it myself.'

     "These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will
     read them to you, as I read them in the old study that night to him.
     They are endorsed outside, as you see, 'Some particulars of the
     voyage of the bark Gloria Scott, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th
     October, 1855, to her destruction in N. Lat. 15° 20', W. Long. 25°
     14' on Nov. 6th.' It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this
     way:

     "'My dear, dear son, now that approaching disgrace begins to darken
     the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty
     that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my
     position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have
     known me, which cuts me to the heart; but it is the thought that you
     should come to blush for me--you who love me and who have seldom, I
     hope, had reason to do other than respect me. But if the blow falls
     which is forever hanging over me, then I should wish you to read
     this, that you may know straight from me how far I have been to
     blame. On the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind God
     Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still
     undestroyed and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by all
     you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love
     which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give
     one thought to it again.

     "'If then your eye goes onto read this line, I know that I shall
     already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more
     likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue
     sealed forever in death. In either case the time for suppression is
     past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I
     swear as I hope for mercy.

     "'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my
     younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me
     a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which
     seemed to imply that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was
     that I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage I was
     convicted of breaking my country's laws, and was sentenced to
     transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
     debt of honor, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money which
     was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it
     before there could be any possibility of its being missed. But the
     most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had reckoned
     upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts
     exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with,
     but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than
     now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a
     felon with thirty-seven other convicts in 'tween-decks of the bark
     Gloria Scott, bound for Australia.

     "'It was the year '55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the
     old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black
     Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less
     suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. The Gloria Scott
     had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
     heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her
     out. She was a five-hundred-ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight
     jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a
     captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly
     a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from
     Falmouth.

     "'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being
     of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and
     frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had
     particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a young
     man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather
     nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a
     swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for
     his extraordinary height. I don't think any of our heads would have
     come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have
     measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many
     sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and
     resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I
     was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still
     when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear,
     and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which
     separated us.

     "'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here
     for?"

     "'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.

     "'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and by God! You'll learn to bless
     my name before you've done with me."

     "'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an
     immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own
     arrest. He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of
     incurably vicious habits, who had, by an ingenious system of fraud,
     obtained huge sums of money from the leading London merchants.

     "'"Ha, ha! You remember my case!" said he proudly.

     "'"Very well, indeed."

     "'"Then maybe you remember something queer about it?"

     "'"What was that, then?"

     "'"I'd had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn't I?"

     "'"So it was said."

     "'"But none was recovered, eh?"

     "'"No."

     "'"Well, where d'ye suppose the balance is?" he asked.

     "'"I have no idea," said I.

     "'"Right between my finger and thumb," he cried. "By God! I've got
     more pounds to my name than you've hairs on your head. And if you've
     money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do
     anything. Now, you don't think it likely that a man who could do
     anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking
     hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a Chin
     China coaster. No, sir, such a man will look after himself and will
     look after his chums. You may lay to that! You hold on to him, and
     you may kiss the book that he'll haul you through."

     "'That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant
     nothing; but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in
     with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really
     was a plot to gain command of the vessel. A dozen of the prisoners
     had hatched it before they came aboard, Prendergast was the leader,
     and his money was the motive power.

     "'"I'd a partner," said he, "a rare good man, as true as a stock to a
     barrel. He's got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at
     this moment?  Why, he's the chaplain of this ship--the chaplain, no
     less! He came aboard with a black coat, and his papers right, and
     money enough in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to
     main-truck. The crew are his, body and soul. He could buy 'em at so
     much a gross with a cash discount, and he did it before ever they
     signed on. He's got two of the warders and Mercer, the second mate,
     and he'd get the captain himself, if he thought him worth it."

     "'"What are we to do, then?" I asked.

     "'"What do you think?" said he. "We'll make the coats of some of
     these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did."

     "'"But they are armed," said I.

     "'"And so shall we be, my boy. There's a brace of pistols for every
     mother's son of us, and if we can't carry this ship, with the crew at
     our back, it's time we were all sent to a young misses'
     boarding-school. You speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and
     see if he is to be trusted."

     "'I did so, and found my other neighbor to be a young fellow in much
     the same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. His name
     was Evans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and he is now a
     rich and prosperous man in the south of England. He was ready enough
     to join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and
     before we had crossed the Bay there were only two of the prisoners
     who were not in the secret. One of these was of weak mind, and we did
     not dare to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice, and
     could not be of any use to us.

     "'From the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us from
     taking possession of the ship. The crew were a set of ruffians,
     specially picked for the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells
     to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts,
     and so often did he come that by the third day we had each stowed
     away at the foot of our beds a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of
     powder, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders were agents of
     Prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man. The captain,
     the two mates, two warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen soldiers,
     and the doctor were all that we had against us. Yet, safe as it was,
     we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack
     suddenly by night. It came, however, more quickly than we expected,
     and in this way.

     "'One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had
     come down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting his
     hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of the
     pistols. If he had been silent he might have blown the whole thing,
     but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and
     turned so pale that the man knew what was up in an instant and seized
     him. He was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon
     the bed. He had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were
     through it in a rush. The two sentries were shot down, and so was a
     corporal who came running to see what was the matter. There were two
     more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed
     not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot
     while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into the
     captain's cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an
     explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared over
     the chart of the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table, while the
     chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow. The
     two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business
     seemed to be settled.

     "'The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and
     flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just
     mad with the feeling that we were free once more. There were lockers
     all round, and Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and
     pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. We cracked off the necks of the
     bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing
     them off, when in an instant without warning there came the roar of
     muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we
     could not see across the table. When it cleared again the place was a
     shambles. Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each
     other on the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table
     turn me sick now when I think of it. We were so cowed by the sight
     that I think we should have given the job up if had not been for
     Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all
     that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the poop
     were the lieutenent and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the
     saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through
     the slit.  We got on them before they could load, and they stood to
     it like men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes
     it was all over. My God! Was there ever a slaughter-house like that
     ship! Predergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers
     up as if they had been children and threw them overboard alive or
     dead. There was one sergeant that was horribly wounded and yet kept
     on swimming for a surprising time, until some one in mercy blew out
     his brains. When the fighting was over there was no one left of our
     enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor.

     "'It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many of
     us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no
     wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the
     soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another
     to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. Eight of us,
     five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done.
     But there was no moving Predergast and those who were with him. Our
     only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and
     he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. It
     nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he
     said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. We jumped at the
     offer, for we were already sick of these blookthirsty doings, and we
     saw that there would be worse before it was done. We were given a
     suit of sailor togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk
     and one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw us over a
     chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had
     foundered in Lat. 15° and Long. 25° west, and then cut the painter
     and let us go.

     "'And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear
     son. The seamen had hauled the fore-yard aback during the rising, but
     now as we left them they brought it square again, and as there was a
     light wind from the north and east the bark began to draw slowly away
     from us. Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth
     rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated of the party,
     were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what
     coast we should make for. It was a nice question, for the Cape de
     Verds were about five hundred miles to the north of us, and the
     African coast about seven hundred to the east. On the whole, as the
     wind was coming round to the north, we thought that Sierra Leone
     might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the bark being
     at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as
     we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from
     her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. A few
     seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the
     smoke thinned away there was no sign left of the Gloria Scott. In an
     instant we swept the boat's head round again and pulled with all our
     strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the water
     marked the scene of this catastrophe.

     "'It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared
     that we had come too late to save any one. A splintered boat and a
     number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the
     waves showed us where the vessel had foundered; but there was no sign
     of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for
     help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying
     stretched across it. When we pulled him aboard the boat he proved to
     be a young seaman of the name of Hudson, who was so burned and
     exhausted that he could give us no account of what had happened until
     the following morning.

     "'It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had
     proceeded to put to death the five remaining prisoners. The two
     warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third
     mate. Prendergast then descended into the 'tween-decks and with his
     own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon. There only
     remained the first mate, who was a bold and active man. When he saw
     the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand he
     kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and
     rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. A dozen
     convicts, who descended with their pistols in search of him, found
     him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open powder-barrel,
     which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that he
     would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. An instant
     later the explosion occurred, though Hudson thought it was caused by
     the misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate's
     match. Be the cause what I may, it was the end of the Gloria Scott
     and of the rabble who held command of her.

     "'Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible
     business in which I was involved. Next day we were picked up by the
     brig Hotspur, bound for Australia, whose captain found no difficulty
     in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had
     foundered. The transport ship Gloria Scott was set down by the
     Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to
     her true fate. After an excellent voyage the Hotspur landed us at
     Sydney, where Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the
     diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all nations,
     we had no difficulty in losing our former identities. The rest I need
     not relate. We prospered, we traveled, we came back as rich colonials
     to England, and we bought country estates. For more than twenty years
     we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped that our past was
     forever buried. Imagine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who
     came to us I recognized instantly the man who had been picked off the
     wreck. He had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself to live
     upon our fears. You will understand now how it was that I strove to
     keep the peace with him, and you will in some measure sympathize with
     me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his
     other victim with threats upon his tongue.'

     "Underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible,
     'Beddoes writes in cipher to say H. has told all. Sweet Lord, have
     mercy on our souls!'

     "That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor, and
     I think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one.
     The good fellow was heart-broken at it, and went out to the Terai tea
     planting, where I hear that he is doing well. As to the sailor and
     Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on
     which the letter of warning was written. They both disappeared
     utterly and completely. No complaint had been lodged with the police,
     so that Beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had been
     seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had
     done away with Beddoes and had fled. For myself I believe that the
     truth was exactly the opposite. I think that it is most probable that
     Beddoes, pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been
     already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from
     the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. Those
     are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to your
     collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your service."






                               THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL

     An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend
     Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was
     the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he
     affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in
     his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a
     fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional
     in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan,
     coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made
     me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a
     limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the
     coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and
     his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the
     very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself
     virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should
     be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his
     queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a
     hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with
     a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither
     the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.

     Our chambers were always full of chemicals and of criminal relics

     "And you, a trained man of science, believe it to be supernatural?"

     "I do not know what to believe."

     Holmes shrugged his shoulders.

     "I have hitherto confined my investigations to this world," said he.
     "In a modest way I have combated evil, but to take on the Father of
     Evil himself would, perhaps, be too ambitious a task. Yet you must
     admit that the footmark is material."

     "The original hound was material enough to tug a man's throat out,
     and yet he was diabolical as well."

     "I see that you have quite gone over to the supernaturalists. But
     now, Dr. Mortimer, tell me this. If you hold these views, why have
     you come to consult me at all? You tell me in the same breath that it
     is useless to investigate Sir Charles's death, and that you desire me
     to do it."

     "I did not say that I desired you to do it."

     "Then, how can I assist you?"

     "By advising me as to what I should do with Sir Henry Baskerville,
     who arrives at Waterloo Station"--Dr. Mortimer looked at his
     watch--"in exactly one hour and a quarter."

     "He being the heir?"

     "Yes. On the death of Sir Charles we inquired for this young
     gentleman and found that he had been farming in Canada. From the
     accounts which have reached us he is an excellent fellow in every
     way. I speak not as a medical man but as a trustee and executor of
     Sir Charles's will."

     "There is no other claimant, I presume?"

     "None. The only other kinsman whom we have been able to trace was
     Rodger Baskerville, the youngest of three brothers of whom poor Sir
     Charles was the elder. The second brother, who died young, is the
     father of this lad Henry. The third, Rodger, was the black sheep of
     the family. He came of the old masterful Baskerville strain, and was
     the very image, they tell me, of the family picture of old Hugo. He
     made England too hot to hold him, fled to Central America, and died
     there in 1876 of yellow fever. Henry is the last of the Baskervilles.
     In one hour and five minutes I meet him at Waterloo Station. I have
     had a wire that he arrived at Southampton this morning. Now, Mr.
     Holmes, what would you advise me to do with him?"

     "Why should he not go to the home of his fathers?"

     "It seems natural, does it not? And yet, consider that every
     Baskerville who goes there meets with an evil fate. I feel sure that
     if Sir Charles could have spoken with me before his death he would
     have warned me against bringing this, the last of the old race, and
     the heir to great wealth, to that deadly place. And yet it cannot be
     denied that the prosperity of the whole poor, bleak country-side
     depends upon his presence. All the good work which has been done by
     Sir Charles will crash to the ground if there is no tenant of the
     Hall. I fear lest I should be swayed too much by my own obvious
     interest in the matter, and that is why I bring the case before you
     and ask for your advice."

     Holmes considered for a little time.

     "Put into plain words, the matter is this," said he. "In your opinion
     there is a diabolical agency which makes Dartmoor an unsafe abode for
     a Baskerville--that is your opinion?"

     "At least I might go the length of saying that there is some evidence
     that this may be so."

     "Exactly. But surely, if your supernatural theory be correct, it
     could work the young man evil in London as easily as in Devonshire. A
     devil with merely local powers like a parish vestry would be too
     inconceivable a thing."

     "You put the matter more flippantly, Mr. Holmes, than you would
     probably do if you were brought into personal contact with these
     things. Your advice, then, as I understand it, is that the young man
     will be as safe in Devonshire as in London. He comes in fifty
     minutes. What would you recommend?"

     "I recommend, sir, that you take a cab, call off your spaniel who is
     scratching at my front door, and proceed to Waterloo to meet Sir
     Henry Baskerville."

     "And then?"

     "And then you will say nothing to him at all until I have made up my
     mind about the matter."

     "How long will it take you to make up your mind?"

     "Twenty-four hours. At ten o'clock to-morrow, Dr. Mortimer, I will be
     much obliged to you if you will call upon me here, and it will be of
     help to me in my plans for the future if you will bring Sir Henry
     Baskerville with you."

     "I will do so, Mr. Holmes." He scribbled the appointment on his
     shirtcuff and hurried off in his strange, peering, absent-minded
     fashion. Holmes stopped him at the head of the stair.

     "Only one more question, Dr. Mortimer. You say that before Sir
     Charles Baskerville's death several people saw this apparition upon
     the moor?"

     "Three people did."

     "Did any see it after?"

     "I have not heard of any."

     "Thank you. Good morning."

     Holmes returned to his seat with that quiet look of inward
     satisfaction which meant that he had a congenial task before him.

     "Going out, Watson?"

     "Unless I can help you."

     "No, my dear fellow, it is at the hour of action that I turn to you
     for aid. But this is splendid, really unique from some points of
     view. When you pass Bradley's, would you ask him to send up a pound
     of the strongest shag tobacco? Thank you. It would be as well if you
     could make it convenient not to return before evening. Then I should
     be very glad to compare impressions as to this most interesting
     problem which has been submitted to us this morning."

     I knew that seclusion and solitude were very necessary for my friend
     in those hours of intense mental concentration during which he
     weighed every particle of evidence, constructed alternative theories,
     balanced one against the other, and made up his mind as to which
     points were essential and which immaterial. I therefore spent the day
     at my club and did not return to Baker Street until evening. It was
     nearly nine o'clock when I found myself in the sitting-room once
     more.

     My first impression as I opened the door was that a fire had broken
     out, for the room was so filled with smoke that the light of the lamp
     upon the table was blurred by it. As I entered, however, my fears
     were set at rest, for it was the acrid fumes of strong coarse tobacco
     which took me by the throat and set me coughing. Through the haze I
     had a vague vision of Holmes in his dressing-gown coiled up in an
     armchair with his black clay pipe between his lips. Several rolls of
     paper lay around him.

     "Caught cold, Watson?" said he.

     "No, it's this poisonous atmosphere."

     "I suppose it is pretty thick, now that you mention it."

     "Thick! It is intolerable."

     "Open the window, then! You have been at your club all day, I
     perceive."

     "My dear Holmes!"

     "Am I right?"

     "Certainly, but how?"

     He laughed at my bewildered expression.

     "There is a delightful freshness about you, Watson, which makes it a
     pleasure to exercise any small powers which I possess at your
     expense. A gentleman goes forth on a showery and miry day. He returns
     immaculate in the evening with the gloss still on his hat and his
     boots. He has been a fixture therefore all day. He is not a man with
     intimate friends. Where, then, could he have been? Is it not
     obvious?"

     "Well, it is rather obvious."

     "The world is full of obvious things which nobody by any chance ever
     observes. Where do you think that I have been?"

     "A fixture also."

     "On the contrary, I have been to Devonshire."

     "In spirit?"

     "Exactly. My body has remained in this arm-chair and has, I regret to
     observe, consumed in my absence two large pots of coffee and an
     incredible amount of tobacco. After you left I sent down to
     Stamford's for the Ordnance map of this portion of the moor, and my
     spirit has hovered over it all day. I flatter myself that I could
     find my way about."

     "A large scale map, I presume?"

     "Very large." He unrolled one section and held it over his knee.
     "Here you have the particular district which concerns us. That is
     Baskerville Hall in the middle."

     "With a wood round it?"

     "Exactly. I fancy the Yew Alley, though not marked under that name,
     must stretch along this line, with the moor, as you perceive, upon
     the right of it. This small clump of buildings here is the hamlet of
     Grimpen, where our friend Dr. Mortimer has his headquarters. Within a
     radius of five miles there are, as you see, only a very few scattered
     dwellings. Here is Lafter Hall, which was mentioned in the narrative.
     There is a house indicated here which may be the residence of the
     naturalist--Stapleton, if I remember right, was his name. Here are
     two moorland farm-houses, High Tor and Foulmire. Then fourteen miles
     away the great convict prison of Princetown. Between and around these
     scattered points extends the desolate, lifeless moor. This, then, is
     the stage upon which tragedy has been played, and upon which we may
     help to play it again."

     "It must be a wild place."

     "Yes, the setting is a worthy one. If the devil did desire to have a
     hand in the affairs of men--"

     "Then you are yourself inclining to the supernatural explanation."

     "The devil's agents may be of flesh and blood, may they not? There
     are two questions waiting for us at the outset. The one is whether
     any crime has been committed at all; the second is, what is the crime
     and how was it committed? Of course, if Dr. Mortimer's surmise should
     be correct, and we are dealing with forces outside the ordinary laws
     of Nature, there is an end of our investigation. But we are bound to
     exhaust all other hypotheses before falling back upon this one. I
     think we'll shut that window again, if you don't mind. It is a
     singular thing, but I find that a concentrated atmosphere helps a
     concentration of thought. I have not pushed it to the length of
     getting into a box to think, but that is the logical outcome of my
     convictions. Have you turned the case over in your mind?"

     "Yes, I have thought a good deal of it in the course of the day."

     "What do you make of it?"
     consulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw any light upon it.
     could possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year's
     had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
     disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of
     Beppo for some crime of violence, an event which took place in the
     factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were
     being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you
     see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they
     presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He
     may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's
     confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his
     sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.

     "The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment, when it
     was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made for the
     factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few
     minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which
     would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six plaster
     casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them was still
     soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in
     the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered
     over the aperture once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one
     could possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year's
     imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over
     London. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by
     breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him nothing, for
     as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to
     it--as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted
     his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a
     cousin who works with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had
     bought the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson,
     and in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.
     Then, with the help of some Italian employe, he succeeded in finding
     out where the other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker's.
     There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible
     for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which
     followed."

     "If he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph?" I
     asked.

     "As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any
     third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after the murder I
     calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his
     movements. He would fear that the police would read his secret, and
     so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him. Of course, I
     could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker's bust. I had
     not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl; but it was
     evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the
     bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which
     had a lamp overlooking it. Since Harker's bust was one in three the
     chances were exactly as I told you, two to one against the pearl
     being inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he
     would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the house,
     so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down with the happiest
     results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the
     Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man linked
     the one event with the other. There only remained a single bust--the
     Reading one--and the pearl must be there. I bought it in your
     presence from the owner--and there it lies."

     We sat in silence for a moment.

     "Well," said Lestrade, "I've seen you handle a good many cases, Mr.
     Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than
     that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very
     proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there's not a man, from
     the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad
     to shake you by the hand."

     "Thank you!" said Holmes. "Thank you!" and as he turned away it
     seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human
     emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold and
     practical thinker once more. "Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,"
     said he, "and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case.
     Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes your way I shall be
     happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution."





                       THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS

     It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I
     need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some
     weeks in one of our great University towns, and it was during this
     time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to
     relate befell us. It will be obvious that any details which would
     help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would
     be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scandal may well be
     allowed to die out. With due discretion the incident itself may,
     however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those
     qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour in my
     statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to
     any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.

     We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library
     where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early
     English charters--researches which led to results so striking that
     they may be the subject of one of my future narratives. Here it was
     that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton
     Soames, tutor and lecturer at the College of St. Luke's. Mr. Soames
     was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had
     always known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular
     occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it
     was clear something very unusual had occurred.

     "I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your
     valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke's, and
     really, but for the happy chance of your being in the town, I should
     have been at a loss what to do."

     "I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions," my friend
     answered. "I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the
     police."

     "No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. When once
     the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of
     those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most
     essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known as your
     powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me. I beg
     you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can."

     My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the
     congenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without his scrap-books, his
     chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man. He
     shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor
     in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth
     his story.

     "I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day
     of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am one of the
     examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists
     of a large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not
     seen. This passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would
     naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it
     in advance. For this reason great care is taken to keep the paper
     secret.

     "To-day about three o'clock the proofs of this paper arrived from the
     printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides. I
     had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely
     correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed. I had,
     however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the
     proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an hour.

     "You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double--a
     green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I approached
     my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I
     imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I
     found that it was all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far
     as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man
     who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is
     absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that
     he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very
     carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my
     room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His
     forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other
     occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable
     consequences.

     "'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.
     rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had
     eyes that comes back to me in my dreams.  His hair and whiskers were
     shot with gray, and his face was all crinkled and puckered like a

     the mangrove-tree, all night chained up in the filthy convict-huts,
     occasion of the interpreter's visit, she had seen him for the first
     time.  The poor girl, however, was herself a prisoner, for there was
     over spilled milk."

     The men came in good time as arranged. They were outwardly
     green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I approached
     my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I
     imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I
     found that it was all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far
     as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man
     who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is
     absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that
     he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very
     carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my
     room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His
     forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other
     occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable
     consequences.

     "The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had
     rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had
     left them all together. Now, I found that one of them was lying on
     the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third
     was where I had left it."

     Holmes stirred for the first time.

     "The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third
     where you left it," said he.

     "Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possibly know
     that?"

     "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

     "For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable
     liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however, with the
     utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the
     in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the
     papers. A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a
     very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk
     in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.

     "This is most interesting," said Holmes. "Pray what did you do then?"

     "And I feel dissatisfied. It is this infernal St. Simon marriage
     should have been written?"

     room, accompanied by a strange animal, and that he either struck the





                                THE NAVAL TREATY

     The July which immediately succeeded my marriage was made memorable
     by three cases of interest, in which I had the privilege of being
     associated with Sherlock Holmes and of studying his methods. I find
     them recorded in my notes under the headings of "The Adventure of the
     Second Stain," "The Adventure of the Naval Treaty," and "The
     Adventure of the Tired Captain." The first of these, however, deals
     with interest of such importance and implicates so many of the first
     families in the kingdom that for many years it will be impossible to
     make it public. No case, however, in which Holmes was engaged has
     ever illustrated the value of his analytical methods so clearly or
     has impressed those who were associated with him so deeply. I still
     retain an almost verbatim report of the interview in which he
     demonstrated the true facts of the case to Monsieur Dubugue of the
     Paris police, and Fritz von Waldbaum, the well-known specialist of
     Dantzig, both of whom had wasted their energies upon what proved to
     be side-issues. The new century will have come, however, before the
     story can be safely told. Meanwhile I pass on to the second on my
     list, which promised also at one time to be of national importance,
     and was marked by several incidents which give it a quite unique
     character.

     During my school-days I had been intimately associated with a lad
     named Percy Phelps, who was of much the same age as myself, though he
     was two classes ahead of me. He was a very brilliant boy, and carried
     away every prize which the school had to offer, finishing his
     exploits by winning a scholarship which sent him on to continue his
     triumphant career at Cambridge. He was, I remember, extremely well
     connected, and even when we were all little boys together we knew
     that his mother's brother was Lord Holdhurst, the great conservative
     politician. This gaudy relationship did him little good at school. On
     the contrary, it seemed rather a piquant thing to us to chevy him
     about the playground and hit him over the shins with a wicket. But it
     was another thing when he came out into the world. I heard vaguely
     that his abilities and the influences which he commanded had won him
     a good position at the Foreign Office, and then he passed completely
     out of my mind until the following letter recalled his existence:

                      late of the Army Medical Department.)





          CHAPTER I
          Mr. Sherlock Holmes


     In the year 1878 I took my degree of Doctor of Medicine of the
     University of London, and proceeded to Netley to go through the
     course prescribed for surgeons in the army. Having completed my
     studies there, I was duly attached to the Fifth Northumberland
     Fusiliers as Assistant Surgeon. The regiment was stationed in India
     at the time, and before I could join it, the second Afghan war had
     broken out. On landing at Bombay, I learned that my corps had
     advanced through the passes, and was already deep in the enemy's
     country. I followed, however, with many other officers who were in
     the same situation as myself, and succeeded in reaching Candahar in
     safety, where I found my regiment, and at once entered upon my new
     duties.

     The campaign brought honours and promotion to many, but for me it had
     nothing but misfortune and disaster. I was removed from my brigade
     and attached to the Berkshires, with whom I served at the fatal
     battle of Maiwand. There I was struck on the shoulder by a Jezail
     bullet, which shattered the bone and grazed the subclavian artery. I
     should have fallen into the hands of the murderous Ghazis had it not
     been for the devotion and courage shown by Murray, my orderly, who
     threw me across a pack-horse, and succeeded in bringing me safely to
     the British lines.

     Worn with pain, and weak from the prolonged hardships which I had
     undergone, I was removed, with a great train of wounded sufferers, to
     the base hospital at Peshawar. Here I rallied, and had already
     improved so far as to be able to walk about the wards, and even to
     bask a little upon the verandah, when I was struck down by enteric
     fever, that curse of our Indian possessions. For months my life was
     despaired of, and when at last I came to myself and became
     convalescent, I was so weak and emaciated that a medical board
     determined that not a day should be lost in sending me back to
     England. I was dispatched, accordingly, in the troopship Orontes, and
     landed a month later on Portsmouth jetty, with my health
     irretrievably ruined, but with permission from a paternal government
     to spend the next nine months in attempting to improve it.

     I had neither kith nor kin in England, and was therefore as free as
     air--or as free as an income of eleven shillings and sixpence a day
     will permit a man to be. Under such circumstances, I naturally
     gravitated to London, that great cesspool into which all the loungers
     and idlers of the Empire are irresistibly drained. There I stayed for
     some time at a private hotel in the Strand, leading a comfortless,
     meaningless existence, and spending such money as I had, considerably
     more freely than I ought. So alarming did the state of my finances
     become, that I soon realized that I must either leave the metropolis
     and rusticate somewhere in the country, or that I must make a
     complete alteration in my style of living. Choosing the latter
     alternative, I began by making up my mind to leave the hotel, and to
     take up my quarters in some less pretentious and less expensive
     domicile.

     On the very day that I had come to this conclusion, I was standing at
     the Criterion Bar, when some one tapped me on the shoulder, and
     turning round I recognized young Stamford, who had been a dresser
     under me at Bart's. The sight of a friendly face in the great
     wilderness of London is a pleasant thing indeed to a lonely man. In
     old days Stamford had never been a particular crony of mine, but now
     I hailed him with enthusiasm, and he, in his turn, appeared to be
     delighted to see me. In the exuberance of my joy, I asked him to
     lunch with me at the Holborn, and we started off together in a
     hansom.

     "Whatever have you been doing with yourself, Watson?" he asked in
     undisguised wonder, as we rattled through the crowded London streets.
     "You are as thin as a lath and as brown as a nut."

     I gave him a short sketch of my adventures, and had hardly concluded
     it by the time that we reached our destination.

     "Poor devil!" he said, commiseratingly, after he had listened to my
     misfortunes. "What are you up to now?"

     "Looking for lodgings," I answered. "Trying to solve the problem as
     to whether it is possible to get comfortable rooms at a reasonable
     price."

     "That's a strange thing," remarked my companion; "you are the second
     man to-day that has used that expression to me."

     "And who was the first?" I asked.

     "A fellow who is working at the chemical laboratory up at the
     hospital. He was bemoaning himself this morning because he could not
     get someone to go halves with him in some nice rooms which he had
     found, and which were too much for his purse."

     "By Jove!" I cried, "if he really wants someone to share the rooms
     and the expense, I am the very man for him. I should prefer having a
     partner to being alone."

     Young Stamford looked rather strangely at me over his wine-glass.
     "You don't know Sherlock Holmes yet," he said; "perhaps you would not
     care for him as a constant companion."

     "Why, what is there against him?"

     "Oh, I didn't say there was anything against him. He is a little
     queer in his ideas--an enthusiast in some branches of science. As far
     as I know he is a decent fellow enough."

     "A medical student, I suppose?" said I.

     "No--I have no idea what he intends to go in for. I believe he is
     well up in anatomy, and he is a first-class chemist; but, as far as I
     know, he has never taken out any systematic medical classes. His
     studies are very desultory and eccentric, but he has amassed a lot of
     out-of-the way knowledge which would astonish his professors."

     "Did you never ask him what he was going in for?" I asked.

     "No; he is not a man that it is easy to draw out, though he can be
     communicative enough when the fancy seizes him."

     "I should like to meet him," I said. "If I am to lodge with anyone, I
     should prefer a man of studious and quiet habits. I am not strong
     enough yet to stand much noise or excitement. I had enough of both in
     Afghanistan to last me for the remainder of my natural existence. How
     could I meet this friend of yours?"

     "He is sure to be at the laboratory," returned my companion. "He
     either avoids the place for weeks, or else he works there from
     morning to night. If you like, we shall drive round together after
     luncheon."

     "Certainly," I answered, and the conversation drifted away into other
     channels.

     As we made our way to the hospital after leaving the Holborn,
     Stamford gave me a few more particulars about the gentleman whom I
     proposed to take as a fellow-lodger.

     "You mustn't blame me if you don't get on with him," he said; "I know
     nothing more of him than I have learned from meeting him occasionally
     in the laboratory. You proposed this arrangement, so you must not
     hold me responsible."

     "If we don't get on it will be easy to part company," I answered. "It
     seems to me, Stamford," I added, looking hard at my companion, "that
     you have some reason for washing your hands of the matter. Is this
     fellow's temper so formidable, or what is it? Don't be mealy-mouthed
     about it."

     "It is not easy to express the inexpressible," he answered with a
     laugh. "Holmes is a little too scientific for my tastes--it
     approaches to cold-bloodedness. I could imagine his giving a friend a
     little pinch of the latest vegetable alkaloid, not out of
     malevolence, you understand, but simply out of a spirit of inquiry in
     order to have an accurate idea of the effects. To do him justice, I
     think that he would take it himself with the same readiness. He
     appears to have a passion for definite and exact knowledge."

     "Very right too."

     "Yes, but it may be pushed to excess. When it comes to beating the
     subjects in the dissecting-rooms with a stick, it is certainly taking
     rather a bizarre shape."

     "Beating the subjects!"

     "Yes, to verify how far bruises may be produced after death. I saw
     him at it with my own eyes."

     "And yet you say he is not a medical student?"

     "No. Heaven knows what the objects of his studies are. But here we
     are, and you must form your own impressions about him." As he spoke,
     we turned down a narrow lane and passed through a small side-door,
     which opened into a wing of the great hospital. It was familiar
     ground to me, and I needed no guiding as we ascended the bleak stone
     staircase and made our way down the long corridor with its vista of
     whitewashed wall and dun-coloured doors. Near the further end a low
     arched passage branched away from it and led to the chemical
     laboratory.

     This was a lofty chamber, lined and littered with countless bottles.
     Broad, low tables were scattered about, which bristled with retorts,
     test-tubes, and little Bunsen lamps, with their blue flickering
     flames. There was only one student in the room, who was bending over
     a distant table absorbed in his work. At the sound of our steps he
     glanced round and sprang to his feet with a cry of pleasure. "I've
     found it! I've found it," he shouted to my companion, running towards
     us with a test-tube in his hand. "I have found a re-agent which is
     precipitated by hoemoglobin, and by nothing else." Had he discovered
     a gold mine, greater delight could not have shone upon his features.

     "Dr. Watson, Mr. Sherlock Holmes," said Stamford, introducing us.

     "How are you?" he said cordially, gripping my hand with a strength
     for which I should hardly have given him credit. "You have been in
     Afghanistan, I perceive."

     "How on earth did you know that?" I asked in astonishment.

     "Never mind," said he, chuckling to himself. "The question now is
     about hoemoglobin. No doubt you see the significance of this
     discovery of mine?"

     "It is interesting, chemically, no doubt," I answered, "but
     practically--"

     "Why, man, it is the most practical medico-legal discovery for years.
     Don't you see that it gives us an infallible test for blood stains.
     Come over here now!" He seized me by the coat-sleeve in his
     eagerness, and drew me over to the table at which he had been
     working. "Let us have some fresh blood," he said, digging a long
     bodkin into his finger, and drawing off the resulting drop of blood
     in a chemical pipette. "Now, I add this small quantity of blood to a
     litre of water. You perceive that the resulting mixture has the
     appearance of pure water. The proportion of blood cannot be more than
     one in a million. I have no doubt, however, that we shall be able to
     obtain the characteristic reaction." As he spoke, he threw into the
     vessel a few white crystals, and then added some drops of a
     transparent fluid. In an instant the contents assumed a dull mahogany
     colour, and a brownish dust was precipitated to the bottom of the
     glass jar.

     "Ha! ha!" he cried, clapping his hands, and looking as delighted as a
     child with a new toy. "What do you think of that?"

     "It seems to be a very delicate test," I remarked.

     "Beautiful! beautiful! The old Guiacum test was very clumsy and
     uncertain. So is the microscopic examination for blood corpuscles.
     The latter is valueless if the stains are a few hours old. Now, this
     appears to act as well whether the blood is old or new. Had this test
     been invented, there are hundreds of men now walking the earth who
     would long ago have paid the penalty of their crimes."

     "Indeed!" I murmured.

     "Criminal cases are continually hinging upon that one point. A man is
     suspected of a crime months perhaps after it has been committed. His
     linen or clothes are examined, and brownish stains discovered upon
     them. Are they blood stains, or mud stains, or rust stains, or fruit
     stains, or what are they? That is a question which has puzzled many
     an expert, and why? Because there was no reliable test. Now we have
     the Sherlock Holmes' test, and there will no longer be any
     difficulty."

     His eyes fairly glittered as he spoke, and he put his hand over his
     heart and bowed as if to some applauding crowd conjured up by his
     imagination.

     "You are to be congratulated," I remarked, considerably surprised at
     his enthusiasm.

     "There was the case of Von Bischoff at Frankfort last year. He would
     certainly have been hung had this test been in existence. Then there
     was Mason of Bradford, and the notorious Muller, and Lefevre of
     Montpellier, and Samson of new Orleans. I could name a score of cases
     in which it would have been decisive."

     "You seem to be a walking calendar of crime," said Stamford with a
     laugh. "You might start a paper on those lines. Call it the 'Police
     News of the Past.'"

     "Very interesting reading it might be made, too," remarked Sherlock
     Holmes, sticking a small piece of plaster over the prick on his
     finger. "I have to be careful," he continued, turning to me with a
     smile, "for I dabble with poisons a good deal." He held out his hand
     as he spoke, and I noticed that it was all mottled over with similar
     pieces of plaster, and discoloured with strong acids.

     "We came here on business," said Stamford, sitting down on a high
     three-legged stool, and pushing another one in my direction with his
     foot. "My friend here wants to take diggings, and as you were
     complaining that you could get no one to go halves with you, I
     thought that I had better bring you together."

     Sherlock Holmes seemed delighted at the idea of sharing his rooms
     with me. "I have my eye on a suite in Baker Street," he said, "which
     would suit us down to the ground. You don't mind the smell of strong
     tobacco, I hope?"

     "I always smoke 'ship's' myself," I answered.

     "That's good enough. I generally have chemicals about, and
     occasionally do experiments. Would that annoy you?"

     "By no means."

     "Let me see--what are my other shortcomings. I get in the dumps at
     times, and don't open my mouth for days on end. You must not think I
     am sulky when I do that. Just let me alone, and I'll soon be right.
     What have you to confess now? It's just as well for two fellows to
     know the worst of one another before they begin to live together."

     I laughed at this cross-examination. "I keep a bull pup," I said,
     "and I object to rows because my nerves are shaken, and I get up at
     all sorts of ungodly hours, and I am extremely lazy. I have another
     set of vices when I'm well, but those are the principal ones at
     present."

     "Do you include violin-playing in your category of rows?" he asked,
     anxiously.

     "It depends on the player," I answered. "A well-played violin is a
     treat for the gods--a badly-played one--"

     "Oh, that's all right," he cried, with a merry laugh. "I think we may
     consider the thing as settled--that is, if the rooms are agreeable to
     you."

     "When shall we see them?"

     "Call for me here at noon to-morrow, and we'll go together and settle
     everything," he answered.

     "All right--noon exactly," said I, shaking his hand.

     We left him working among his chemicals, and we walked together
     towards my hotel.

     "By the way," I asked suddenly, stopping and turning upon Stamford,
     "how the deuce did he know that I had come from Afghanistan?"

     My companion smiled an enigmatical smile. "That's just his little
     peculiarity," he said. "A good many people have wanted to know how he
     finds things out."

     "Oh! a mystery is it?" I cried, rubbing my hands. "This is very
     piquant. I am much obliged to you for bringing us together. 'The
     proper study of mankind is man,' you know."

     "You must study him, then," Stamford said, as he bade me good-bye.
     "You'll find him a knotty problem, though. I'll wager he learns more
     about you than you about him. Good-bye."

     "Good-bye," I answered, and strolled on to my hotel, considerably
     interested in my new acquaintance.





          CHAPTER II
          The Science Of Deduction


     We met next day as he had arranged, and inspected the rooms at No.
     221b, Baker Street, of which he had spoken at our meeting. They
     consisted of a couple of comfortable bed-rooms and a single large
     airy sitting-room, cheerfully furnished, and illuminated by two broad
     windows. So desirable in every way were the apartments, and so
     moderate did the terms seem when divided between us, that the bargain
     was concluded upon the spot, and we at once entered into possession.
     That very evening I moved my things round from the hotel, and on the
     following morning Sherlock Holmes followed me with several boxes and
     portmanteaus. For a day or two we were busily employed in unpacking
     and laying out our property to the best advantage. That done, we
     gradually began to settle down and to accommodate ourselves to our
     new surroundings.

     Holmes was certainly not a difficult man to live with. He was quiet
     in his ways, and his habits were regular. It was rare for him to be
     up after ten at night, and he had invariably breakfasted and gone out
     before I rose in the morning. Sometimes he spent his day at the
     chemical laboratory, sometimes in the dissecting-rooms, and
     occasionally in long walks, which appeared to take him into the

Iteration: 44000
     "She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up,
     you have no life left in you."

     "Don't mind me," said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips,
     and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning.
     "Married, you say?"

     "Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment
     House. There was some words between young Drebber and young
     Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party
     that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed
     to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council,
     Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to
     him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her
     face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off,
     then?"

     "Yes, I am off," said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat.
     His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was
     its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.

     "Where are you going?"

     "Never mind," he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his
     shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the
     mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there
     was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.

     The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it
     was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful
     marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her
     head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish
     husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John
     Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his
     bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with
     her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were
     grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to
     their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open,
     and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode
     into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he
     walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the
     pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips
     reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he
     took the wedding-ring from her finger. "She shall not be buried in
     that," he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be
     raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief
     was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to
     believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been
     for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as
     having been a bride had disappeared.

     For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading
     a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for
     vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the
     weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which
     haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through
     Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot
     of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great
     boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by
     throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long
     in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led
     repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or
     killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted
     the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of
     having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax
     these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their
     opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.

     Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's
     mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of
     revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no
     room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things
     practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not
     stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and
     want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog
     among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet
     such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that
     that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the
     old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money
     enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.

     His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a
     combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the
     mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory
     of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on
     that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave.
     Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City,
     careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he
     knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There
     had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some
     of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the
     authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a
     certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become
     Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one
     knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed
     to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had
     departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was
     comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their
     whereabouts.

     Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of
     revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never
     faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked
     out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to
     town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed
     into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on,
     a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon
     which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded.
     It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told
     him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit
     of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance
     all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his
     window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder
     in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by
     Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to
     him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and
     hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into
     custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some
     weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that
     Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had
     departed for Europe.

     Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred
     urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and
     for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his
     approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in
     him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to
     city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking
     the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for
     Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just
     set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days
     late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded
     in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do
     better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in
     Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.





          CHAPTER VI
          A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.


     Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any
     ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself
     powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes
     that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. "I guess you're going
     to take me to the police-station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.
     "My cab's at the door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it.
     I'm not so light to lift as I used to be."

     Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this
     proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner
     at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his
     ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself
     that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself,
     as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man;
     and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and
     energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.

     "If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you
     are the man for it," he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at
     my fellow-lodger. "The way you kept on my trail was a caution."

     "You had better come with me," said Holmes to the two detectives.

     "I can drive you," said Lestrade.

     "Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have
     taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us."

     I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made
     no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been
     his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the
     horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We
     were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down
     our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had
     been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who
     went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. "The prisoner will
     be put before the magistrates in the course of the week," he said;
     "in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you
     wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and
     may be used against you."

     "I've got a good deal to say," our prisoner said slowly. "I want to
     tell you gentlemen all about it."

     "Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?" asked the Inspector.

     "I may never be tried," he answered. "You needn't look startled. It
     isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?" He turned his
     fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.

     "Yes; I am," I answered.

     "Then put your hand here," he said, with a smile, motioning with his
     manacled wrists towards his chest.

     I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing
     and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest
     seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when
     some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could
     hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same
     source.

     "Why," I cried, "you have an aortic aneurism!"

     "That's what they call it," he said, placidly. "I went to a Doctor
     last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before
     many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from
     over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've
     done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like
     to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be
     seemed to be a hideous and distorted child, who threw itself upon the
     little figure of the lad who drove him. The boy had some slight
     Holmes rushed to the top of the stairs to draw in the fresh air, and
     remembered as a common cut-throat."


     "That was in all the dailies.  No answer."


     asked.

     "Most certainly there is," I answered.

     "In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to
     take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty, sir, to
     give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down."

     "I'll sit down, with your leave," the prisoner said, suiting the
     action to the word. "This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and
     the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the
     brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I
     say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no
     consequence to me."

     With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began
     the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace
     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I
     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's
     words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.

     "It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's
     enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a
     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their
     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,
     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any
     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should
     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done
     the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my
     place.

     "That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.
     She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart
     over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed
     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his
     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I
     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his
     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to
     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is
     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and
     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left
     for me to hope for, or to desire.

     "They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving
     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a
     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain
     was running hard, with occasional little springs, such as a weary man
     scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle
     education has come from Nature rather than from the schoolmaster. She
     have carried it about with me, and have followed him and his
     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to
     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is
     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and
     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left
     for me to hope for, or to desire.

     "They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving
     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a
     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain
     sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for
     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along
     somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that
     of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most
     confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted
     the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.

     "It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were
     living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across
     them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other
     side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them
     at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their
     recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my
     opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.

     "They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then
     they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or
     late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get
     behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long
     as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.

     "They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there
     was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out
     alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind
     them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was
     drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I
     watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but
     fashion."

     But before we could move the man had emerged again. As he came out
     were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very
     intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He
     was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and
     when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some
     grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed
     therefore when another member of the family came down to live here,
     and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run.
     That was all which I intended to convey.

     "But what is the danger?"

     "I may never be tried," he answered. "You needn't look startled. It
     isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?" He turned his
     fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.

     "Yes; I am," I answered.

     "Hum! There was no use your giving this unnecessary trouble. We have
     had work enough already through you. However, doctor, I need not warn
     you to be careful. Bring the box back with you to the Baker Street
     rooms. You will find us there, on our way to the station."

     They landed me at Vauxhall, with my heavy iron box, and with a bluff,
     genial inspector as my companion. A quarter of an hour's drive
     brought us to Mrs. Cecil Forrester's. The servant seemed surprised at
     so late a visitor. Mrs. Cecil Forrester was out for the evening, she
     explained, and likely to be very late. Miss Morstan, however, was in
     the drawing-room: so to the drawing-room I went, box in hand, leaving
     the obliging inspector in the cab.

     She was seated by the open window, dressed in some sort of white
     diaphanous material, with a little touch of scarlet at the neck and
     waist. The soft light of a shaded lamp fell upon her as she leaned
     back in the basket chair, playing over her sweet, grave face, and
     tinting with a dull, metallic sparkle the rich coils of her luxuriant
     hair. One white arm and hand drooped over the side of the chair, and
     her whole pose and figure spoke of an absorbing melancholy. At the
     sound of my foot-fall she sprang to her feet, however, and a bright
     flush of surprise and of pleasure colored her pale cheeks.

     "I heard a cab drive up," she said. "I thought that Mrs. Forrester
     had come back very early, but I never dreamed that it might be you.
     What news have you brought me?"

     "I have brought something better than news," said I, putting down the
     box upon the table and speaking jovially and boisterously, though my
     heart was heavy within me. "I have brought you something which is
     worth all the news in the world. I have brought you a fortune."

     She glanced at iron box. "Is that the treasure, then?" she asked,
     coolly enough.

     "Yes, this is the great Agra treasure. Half of it is yours and half
     is Thaddeus Sholto's. You will have a couple of hundred thousand
     each. Think of that! An annuity of ten thousand pounds. There will be
     few richer young ladies in England. Is it not glorious?"

     I think that I must have been rather overacting my delight, and that
     she detected a hollow ring in my congratulations, for I saw her
     eyebrows rise a little, and she glanced at me curiously.

     "If I have it," said she, "I owe it to you."

     "No, no," I answered, "not to me, but to my friend Sherlock Holmes.
     With all the will in the world, I could never have followed up a clue
     which has taxed even his analytical genius.  As it was, we very
     nearly lost it at the last moment."

     "Pray sit down and tell me all about it, Dr. Watson," said she.

     I narrated briefly what had occurred since I had seen her
     last,--Holmes's new method of search, the discovery of the Aurora,
     the appearance of Athelney Jones, our expedition in the evening, and
     the wild chase down the Thames. She listened with parted lips and
     shining eyes to my recital of our adventures. When I spoke of the
     dart which had so narrowly missed us, she turned so white that I
     feared that she was about to faint.

     "It is nothing," she said, as I hastened to pour her out some water.
     "I am all right again. It was a shock to me to hear that I had placed
     my friends in such horrible peril."

     "That is all over," I answered. "It was nothing. I will tell you no
     more gloomy details. Let us turn to something brighter. There is the
     treasure. What could be brighter than that? I got leave to bring it
     with me, thinking that it would interest you to be the first to see
     it."

     "It would be of the greatest interest to me," she said. There was no
     eagerness in her voice, however. It had struck her, doubtless, that
     it might seem ungracious upon her part to be indifferent to a prize
     which had cost so much to win.

     "What a pretty box!" she said, stooping over it. "This is Indian
     work, I suppose?"

     "Yes; it is Benares metal-work."

     "And so heavy!" she exclaimed, trying to raise it. "The box alone
     must be of some value. Where is the key?"

     "Small threw it into the Thames," I answered. "I must borrow Mrs.
     Forrester's poker." There was in the front a thick and broad hasp,
     wrought in the image of a sitting Buddha. Under this I thrust the end
     of the poker and twisted it outward as a lever. The hasp sprang open
     with a loud snap. With trembling fingers I flung back the lid. We
     both stood gazing in astonishment. The box was empty!

     No wonder that it was heavy. The iron-work was two-thirds of an inch
     thick all round. It was massive, well made, and solid, like a chest
     constructed to carry things of great price, but not one shred or
     crumb of metal or jewelry lay within it. It was absolutely and
     completely empty.

     "The treasure is lost," said Miss Morstan, calmly.

     As I listened to the words and realized what they meant, a great
     shadow seemed to pass from my soul. I did not know how this Agra
     treasure had weighed me down, until now that it was finally removed.
     It was selfish, no doubt, disloyal, wrong, but I could realize
     nothing save that the golden barrier was gone from between us. "Thank
     God!" I ejaculated from my very heart.

     She looked at me with a quick, questioning smile. "Why do you say
     that?" she asked.

     "Because you are within my reach again," I said, taking her hand. She
     did not withdraw it. "Because I love you, Mary, as truly as ever a
     man loved a woman. Because this treasure, these riches, sealed my
     lips. Now that they are gone I can tell you how I love you. That is
     why I said, 'Thank God.'"

     "Then I say, 'Thank God,' too," she whispered, as I drew her to my
     side. Whoever had lost a treasure, I knew that night that I had
     gained one.





          CHAPTER XII
          The Strange Story of Jonathan Small


     A very patient man was that inspector in the cab, for it was a weary
     time before I rejoined him. His face clouded over when I showed him
     the empty box.

     "There goes the reward!" said he, gloomily. "Where there is no money
     there is no pay. This night's work would have been worth a tenner
     each to Sam Brown and me if the treasure had been there."

     "Mr. Thaddeus Sholto is a rich man," I said. "He will see that you
     are rewarded, treasure or no."

     The inspector shook his head despondently, however. "It's a bad job,"
     he repeated; "and so Mr. Athelney Jones will think."

     His forecast proved to be correct, for the detective looked blank
     enough when I got to Baker Street and showed him the empty box. They
     had only just arrived, Holmes, the prisoner, and he, for they had
     changed their plans so far as to report themselves at a station upon
     the way. My companion lounged in his arm-chair with his usual
     listless expression, while Small sat stolidly opposite to him with
     his wooden leg cocked over his sound one. As I exhibited the empty
     box he leaned back in his chair and laughed aloud.

     "This is your doing, Small," said Athelney Jones, angrily.

     "Yes, I have put it away where you shall never lay hand upon it," he
     cried, exultantly. "It is my treasure; and if I can't have the loot
     I'll take darned good care that no one else does. I tell you that no
     living man has any right to it, unless it is three men who are in the
     Andaman convict-barracks and myself. I know now that I cannot have
     the use of it, and I know that they cannot. I have acted all through
     for them as much as for myself. It's been the sign of four with us
     always. Well I know that they would have had me do just what I have
     done, and throw the treasure into the Thames rather than let it go to
     kith or kin of Sholto or of Morstan. It was not to make them rich
     that we did for Achmet. You'll find the treasure where the key is,
     and where little Tonga is. When I saw that your launch must catch us,

Iteration: 45000
     "She was married yesterday to young Drebber. Hold up, man, hold up,
     you have no life left in you."

     "Don't mind me," said Hope faintly. He was white to the very lips,
     and had sunk down on the stone against which he had been leaning.
     "Married, you say?"

     "Married yesterday--that's what those flags are for on the Endowment
     House. There was some words between young Drebber and young
     Stangerson as to which was to have her. They'd both been in the party
     that followed them, and Stangerson had shot her father, which seemed
     to give him the best claim; but when they argued it out in council,
     Drebber's party was the stronger, so the Prophet gave her over to
     him. No one won't have her very long though, for I saw death in her
     face yesterday. She is more like a ghost than a woman. Are you off,
     then?"

     "Yes, I am off," said Jefferson Hope, who had risen from his seat.
     His face might have been chiselled out of marble, so hard and set was
     its expression, while its eyes glowed with a baleful light.

     "Where are you going?"

     "Never mind," he answered; and, slinging his weapon over his
     shoulder, strode off down the gorge and so away into the heart of the
     mountains to the haunts of the wild beasts. Amongst them all there
     was none so fierce and so dangerous as himself.

     The prediction of the Mormon was only too well fulfilled. Whether it
     was the terrible death of her father or the effects of the hateful
     marriage into which she had been forced, poor Lucy never held up her
     head again, but pined away and died within a month. Her sottish
     husband, who had married her principally for the sake of John
     Ferrier's property, did not affect any great grief at his
     bereavement; but his other wives mourned over her, and sat up with
     her the night before the burial, as is the Mormon custom. They were
     grouped round the bier in the early hours of the morning, when, to
     their inexpressible fear and astonishment, the door was flung open,
     and a savage-looking, weather-beaten man in tattered garments strode
     into the room. Without a glance or a word to the cowering women, he
     walked up to the white silent figure which had once contained the
     pure soul of Lucy Ferrier. Stooping over her, he pressed his lips
     reverently to her cold forehead, and then, snatching up her hand, he
     took the wedding-ring from her finger. "She shall not be buried in
     that," he cried with a fierce snarl, and before an alarm could be
     raised sprang down the stairs and was gone. So strange and so brief
     was the episode, that the watchers might have found it hard to
     believe it themselves or persuade other people of it, had it not been
     for the undeniable fact that the circlet of gold which marked her as
     having been a bride had disappeared.

     For some months Jefferson Hope lingered among the mountains, leading
     a strange wild life, and nursing in his heart the fierce desire for
     vengeance which possessed him. Tales were told in the City of the
     weird figure which was seen prowling about the suburbs, and which
     haunted the lonely mountain gorges. Once a bullet whistled through
     Stangerson's window and flattened itself upon the wall within a foot
     of him. On another occasion, as Drebber passed under a cliff a great
     boulder crashed down on him, and he only escaped a terrible death by
     throwing himself upon his face. The two young Mormons were not long
     in discovering the reason of these attempts upon their lives, and led
     repeated expeditions into the mountains in the hope of capturing or
     killing their enemy, but always without success. Then they adopted
     the precaution of never going out alone or after nightfall, and of
     having their houses guarded. After a time they were able to relax
     these measures, for nothing was either heard or seen of their
     opponent, and they hoped that time had cooled his vindictiveness.

     Far from doing so, it had, if anything, augmented it. The hunter's
     mind was of a hard, unyielding nature, and the predominant idea of
     revenge had taken such complete possession of it that there was no
     room for any other emotion. He was, however, above all things
     practical. He soon realized that even his iron constitution could not
     stand the incessant strain which he was putting upon it. Exposure and
     want of wholesome food were wearing him out. If he died like a dog
     among the mountains, what was to become of his revenge then? And yet
     such a death was sure to overtake him if he persisted. He felt that
     that was to play his enemy's game, so he reluctantly returned to the
     old Nevada mines, there to recruit his health and to amass money
     enough to allow him to pursue his object without privation.

     His intention had been to be absent a year at the most, but a
     combination of unforeseen circumstances prevented his leaving the
     mines for nearly five. At the end of that time, however, his memory
     of his wrongs and his craving for revenge were quite as keen as on
     that memorable night when he had stood by John Ferrier's grave.
     Disguised, and under an assumed name, he returned to Salt Lake City,
     careless what became of his own life, as long as he obtained what he
     knew to be justice. There he found evil tidings awaiting him. There
     had been a schism among the Chosen People a few months before, some
     of the younger members of the Church having rebelled against the
     authority of the Elders, and the result had been the secession of a
     certain number of the malcontents, who had left Utah and become
     Gentiles. Among these had been Drebber and Stangerson; and no one
     knew whither they had gone. Rumour reported that Drebber had managed
     to convert a large part of his property into money, and that he had
     departed a wealthy man, while his companion, Stangerson, was
     comparatively poor. There was no clue at all, however, as to their
     whereabouts.

     Many a man, however vindictive, would have abandoned all thought of
     revenge in the face of such a difficulty, but Jefferson Hope never
     faltered for a moment. With the small competence he possessed, eked
     out by such employment as he could pick up, he travelled from town to
     town through the United States in quest of his enemies. Year passed
     into year, his black hair turned grizzled, but still he wandered on,
     a human bloodhound, with his mind wholly set upon the one object upon
     which he had devoted his life. At last his perseverance was rewarded.
     It was but a glance of a face in a window, but that one glance told
     him that Cleveland in Ohio possessed the men whom he was in pursuit
     of. He returned to his miserable lodgings with his plan of vengeance
     all arranged. It chanced, however, that Drebber, looking from his
     window, had recognized the vagrant in the street, and had read murder
     in his eyes. He hurried before a justice of the peace, accompanied by
     Stangerson, who had become his private secretary, and represented to
     him that they were in danger of their lives from the jealousy and
     hatred of an old rival. That evening Jefferson Hope was taken into
     custody, and not being able to find sureties, was detained for some
     weeks. When at last he was liberated, it was only to find that
     Drebber's house was deserted, and that he and his secretary had
     departed for Europe.

     Again the avenger had been foiled, and again his concentrated hatred
     urged him to continue the pursuit. Funds were wanting, however, and
     for some time he had to return to work, saving every dollar for his
     approaching journey. At last, having collected enough to keep life in
     him, he departed for Europe, and tracked his enemies from city to
     city, working his way in any menial capacity, but never overtaking
     the fugitives. When he reached St. Petersburg they had departed for
     Paris; and when he followed them there he learned that they had just
     set off for Copenhagen. At the Danish capital he was again a few days
     late, for they had journeyed on to London, where he at last succeeded
     in running them to earth. As to what occurred there, we cannot do
     better than quote the old hunter's own account, as duly recorded in
     Dr. Watson's Journal, to which we are already under such obligations.





          CHAPTER VI
          A Continuation Of The Reminiscences Of John Watson, M.D.


     Our prisoner's furious resistance did not apparently indicate any
     ferocity in his disposition towards ourselves, for on finding himself
     powerless, he smiled in an affable manner, and expressed his hopes
     that he had not hurt any of us in the scuffle. "I guess you're going
     to take me to the police-station," he remarked to Sherlock Holmes.
     "My cab's at the door. If you'll loose my legs I'll walk down to it.
     I'm not so light to lift as I used to be."

     Gregson and Lestrade exchanged glances as if they thought this
     proposition rather a bold one; but Holmes at once took the prisoner
     at his word, and loosened the towel which we had bound round his
     ankles. He rose and stretched his legs, as though to assure himself
     that they were free once more. I remember that I thought to myself,
     as I eyed him, that I had seldom seen a more powerfully built man;
     and his dark sunburned face bore an expression of determination and
     energy which was as formidable as his personal strength.

     "If there's a vacant place for a chief of the police, I reckon you
     are the man for it," he said, gazing with undisguised admiration at
     my fellow-lodger. "The way you kept on my trail was a caution."

     "You had better come with me," said Holmes to the two detectives.

     "I can drive you," said Lestrade.

     "Good! and Gregson can come inside with me. You too, Doctor, you have
     taken an interest in the case and may as well stick to us."

     I assented gladly, and we all descended together. Our prisoner made
     no attempt at escape, but stepped calmly into the cab which had been
     his, and we followed him. Lestrade mounted the box, whipped up the
     horse, and brought us in a very short time to our destination. We
     were ushered into a small chamber where a police Inspector noted down
     our prisoner's name and the names of the men with whose murder he had
     been charged. The official was a white-faced unemotional man, who
     went through his duties in a dull mechanical way. "The prisoner will
     be put before the magistrates in the course of the week," he said;
     "in the mean time, Mr. Jefferson Hope, have you anything that you
     wish to say? I must warn you that your words will be taken down, and
     may be used against you."

     "I've got a good deal to say," our prisoner said slowly. "I want to
     tell you gentlemen all about it."

     "Hadn't you better reserve that for your trial?" asked the Inspector.

     "I may never be tried," he answered. "You needn't look startled. It
     isn't suicide I am thinking of. Are you a Doctor?" He turned his
     fierce dark eyes upon me as he asked this last question.

     "Yes; I am," I answered.

     "Then put your hand here," he said, with a smile, motioning with his
     manacled wrists towards his chest.

     I did so; and became at once conscious of an extraordinary throbbing
     and commotion which was going on inside. The walls of his chest
     seemed to thrill and quiver as a frail building would do inside when
     some powerful engine was at work. In the silence of the room I could
     hear a dull humming and buzzing noise which proceeded from the same
     source.

     "Why," I cried, "you have an aortic aneurism!"

     "That's what they call it," he said, placidly. "I went to a Doctor
     last week about it, and he told me that it is bound to burst before
     many days passed. It has been getting worse for years. I got it from
     over-exposure and under-feeding among the Salt Lake Mountains. I've
     done my work now, and I don't care how soon I go, but I should like
     to leave some account of the business behind me. I don't want to be
     remembered as a common cut-throat."

     The Inspector and the two detectives had a hurried discussion as to
     the advisability of allowing him to tell his story.

     "Do you consider, Doctor, that there is immediate danger?" the former
     asked.

     "Most certainly there is," I answered.

     "In that case it is clearly our duty, in the interests of justice, to
     take his statement," said the Inspector. "You are at liberty, sir, to
     give your account, which I again warn you will be taken down."

     "I'll sit down, with your leave," the prisoner said, suiting the
     action to the word. "This aneurism of mine makes me easily tired, and
     the tussle we had half an hour ago has not mended matters. I'm on the
     brink of the grave, and I am not likely to lie to you. Every word I
     say is the absolute truth, and how you use it is a matter of no
     consequence to me."

     With these words, Jefferson Hope leaned back in his chair and began
     the following remarkable statement. He spoke in a calm and methodical
     manner, as though the events which he narrated were commonplace
     enough. I can vouch for the accuracy of the subjoined account, for I
     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's
     words were taken down exactly as they were uttered.

     "It don't much matter to you why I hated these men," he said; "it's
     enough that they were guilty of the death of two human beings--a
     father and a daughter--and that they had, therefore, forfeited their
     own lives. After the lapse of time that has passed since their crime,
     it was impossible for me to secure a conviction against them in any
     court. I knew of their guilt though, and I determined that I should
     be judge, jury, and executioner all rolled into one. You'd have done
     the same, if you have any manhood in you, if you had been in my
     place.

     "That girl that I spoke of was to have married me twenty years ago.
     She was forced into marrying that same Drebber, and broke her heart
     over it. I took the marriage ring from her dead finger, and I vowed
     that his dying eyes should rest upon that very ring, and that his
     last thoughts should be of the crime for which he was punished. I
     have had access to Lestrade's note-book, in which the prisoner's
     accomplice over two continents until I caught them. They thought to
     tire me out, but they could not do it. If I die to-morrow, as is
     likely enough, I die knowing that my work in this world is done, and
     well done. They have perished, and by my hand. There is nothing left
     for me to hope for, or to desire.

     "They were rich and I was poor, so that it was no easy matter for me
     to follow them. When I got to London my pocket was about empty, and I
     found that I must turn my hand to something for my living. Driving
     and riding are as natural to me as walking, so I applied at a
     cabowner's office, and soon got employment. I was to bring a certain
     sum a week to the owner, and whatever was over that I might keep for
     myself. There was seldom much over, but I managed to scrape along
     somehow. The hardest job was to learn my way about, for I reckon that
     of all the mazes that ever were contrived, this city is the most
     confusing. I had a map beside me though, and when once I had spotted
     the principal hotels and stations, I got on pretty well.

     "It was some time before I found out where my two gentlemen were
     living; but I inquired and inquired until at last I dropped across
     them. They were at a boarding-house at Camberwell, over on the other
     side of the river. When once I found them out I knew that I had them
     at my mercy. I had grown my beard, and there was no chance of their
     recognizing me. I would dog them and follow them until I saw my
     opportunity. I was determined that they should not escape me again.

     "They were very near doing it for all that. Go where they would about
     London, I was always at their heels. Sometimes I followed them on my
     cab, and sometimes on foot, but the former was the best, for then
     they could not get away from me. It was only early in the morning or
     late at night that I could earn anything, so that I began to get
     behind hand with my employer. I did not mind that, however, as long
     as I could lay my hand upon the men I wanted.

     "They were very cunning, though. They must have thought that there
     was some chance of their being followed, for they would never go out
     alone, and never after nightfall. During two weeks I drove behind
     them every day, and never once saw them separate. Drebber himself was
     drunk half the time, but Stangerson was not to be caught napping. I
     watched them late and early, but never saw the ghost of a chance; but
     I was not discouraged, for something told me that the hour had almost
     come. My only fear was that this thing in my chest might burst a
     little too soon and leave my work undone.

     "At last, one evening I was driving up and down Torquay Terrace, as
     the street was called in which they boarded, when I saw a cab drive
     up to their door. Presently some luggage was brought out, and after a
     time Drebber and Stangerson followed it, and drove off. I whipped up
     my horse and kept within sight of them, feeling very ill at ease, for
     I feared that they were going to shift their quarters. At Euston
     Station they got out, and I left a boy to hold my horse, and followed
     them on to the platform. I heard them ask for the Liverpool train,
     and the guard answer that one had just gone and there would not be
     another for some hours. Stangerson seemed to be put out at that, but
     Drebber was rather pleased than otherwise. I got so close to them in
     the bustle that I could hear every word that passed between them.
     Drebber said that he had a little business of his own to do, and that
     if the other would wait for him he would soon rejoin him. His
     companion remonstrated with him, and reminded him that they had
     resolved to stick together. Drebber answered that the matter was a
     delicate one, and that he must go alone. I could not catch what
     Stangerson said to that, but the other burst out swearing, and
     reminded him that he was nothing more than his paid servant, and that
     he must not presume to dictate to him. On that the Secretary gave it
     up as a bad job, and simply bargained with him that if he missed the
     last train he should rejoin him at Halliday's Private Hotel; to which
     Drebber answered that he would be back on the platform before eleven,
     and made his way out of the station.

     "The moment for which I had waited so long had at last come. I had my
     enemies within my power. Together they could protect each other, but
     singly they were at my mercy. I did not act, however, with undue
     precipitation. My plans were already formed. There is no satisfaction
     in vengeance unless the offender has time to realize who it is that
     strikes him, and why retribution has come upon him. I had my plans
     arranged by which I should have the opportunity of making the man who
     had wronged me understand that his old sin had found him out. It
     chanced that some days before a gentleman who had been engaged in
     looking over some houses in the Brixton Road had dropped the key of
     one of them in my carriage. It was claimed that same evening, and
     returned; but in the interval I had taken a moulding of it, and had a
     duplicate constructed. By means of this I had access to at least one
     spot in this great city where I could rely upon being free from
     interruption. How to get Drebber to that house was the difficult
     problem which I had now to solve.

     "He walked down the road and went into one or two liquor shops,
     staying for nearly half-an-hour in the last of them. When he came out
     he staggered in his walk, and was evidently pretty well on. There was
     a hansom just in front of me, and he hailed it. I followed it so
     close that the nose of my horse was within a yard of his driver the
     whole way. We rattled across Waterloo Bridge and through miles of
     streets, until, to my astonishment, we found ourselves back in the
     Terrace in which he had boarded. I could not imagine what his
     intention was in returning there; but I went on and pulled up my cab
     a hundred yards or so from the house. He entered it, and his hansom
     drove away. Give me a glass of water, if you please. My mouth gets
     dry with the talking."

     I handed him the glass, and he drank it down.

     "That's better," he said. "Well, I waited for a quarter of an hour,
     or more, when suddenly there came a noise like people struggling
     inside the house. Next moment the door was flung open and two men
     appeared, one of whom was Drebber, and the other was a young chap
     whom I had never seen before. This fellow had Drebber by the collar,
     and when they came to the head of the steps he gave him a shove and a
     kick which sent him half across the road. 'You hound,' he cried,
     shaking his stick at him; 'I'll teach you to insult an honest girl!'
     He was so hot that I think he would have thrashed Drebber with his
     cudgel, only that the cur staggered away down the road as fast as his
     legs would carry him. He ran as far as the corner, and then, seeing
     my cab, he hailed me and jumped in. 'Drive me to Halliday's Private
     Hotel,' said he.

     "When I had him fairly inside my cab, my heart jumped so with joy
     that I feared lest at this last moment my aneurism might go wrong. I
     drove along slowly, weighing in my own mind what it was best to do. I
     might take him right out into the country, and there in some deserted
     lane have my last interview with him. I had almost decided upon this,
     when he solved the problem for me. The craze for drink had seized him
     again, and he ordered me to pull up outside a gin palace. He went in,
     leaving word that I should wait for him. There he remained until
     closing time, and when he came out he was so far gone that I knew the
     game was in my own hands.

     "Don't imagine that I intended to kill him in cold blood. It would
     only have been rigid justice if I had done so, but I could not bring
     myself to do it. I had long determined that he should have a show for
     his life if he chose to take advantage of it. Among the many billets
     which I have filled in America during my wandering life, I was once
     janitor and sweeper out of the laboratory at York College. One day
     the professor was lecturing on poisons, and he showed his students
     some alkaloid, as he called it, which he had extracted from some
     South American arrow poison, and which was so powerful that the least
     grain meant instant death. I spotted the bottle in which this
     preparation was kept, and when they were all gone, I helped myself to
     a little of it. I was a fairly good dispenser, so I worked this
     alkaloid into small, soluble pills, and each pill I put in a box with
     a similar pill made without the poison. I determined at the time that
     when I had my chance, my gentlemen should each have a draw out of one
     of these boxes, while I ate the pill that remained. It would be quite
     as deadly, and a good deal less noisy than firing across a
     handkerchief. From that day I had always my pill boxes about with me,
     and the time had now come when I was to use them.

     "It was nearer one than twelve, and a wild, bleak night, blowing hard
     and raining in torrents. Dismal as it was outside, I was glad
     within--so glad that I could have shouted out from pure exultation.
     If any of you gentlemen have ever pined for a thing, and longed for
     it during twenty long years, and then suddenly found it within your
     reach, you would understand my feelings. I lit a cigar, and puffed at
     it to steady my nerves, but my hands were trembling, and my temples
     throbbing with excitement. As I drove, I could see old John Ferrier
     and sweet Lucy looking at me out of the darkness and smiling at me,
     just as plain as I see you all in this room. All the way they were
     ahead of me, one on each side of the horse until I pulled up at the
     house in the Brixton Road.

     "There was not a soul to be seen, nor a sound to be heard, except the
     dripping of the rain. When I looked in at the window, I found Drebber
     all huddled together in a drunken sleep. I shook him by the arm,
     'It's time to get out,' I said.

     "'All right, cabby,' said he.

     "I suppose he thought we had come to the hotel that he had mentioned,
     for he got out without another word, and followed me down the garden.
     I had to walk beside him to keep him steady, for he was still a
     little top-heavy. When we came to the door, I opened it, and led him
     into the front room. I give you my word that all the way, the father
     and the daughter were walking in front of us.

     "'It's infernally dark,' said he, stamping about.

     "'We'll soon have a light,' I said, striking a match and putting it
     to a wax candle which I had brought with me. 'Now, Enoch Drebber,' I
     continued, turning to him, and holding the light to my own face, 'who
     am I?'

     "He gazed at me with bleared, drunken eyes for a moment, and then I
     saw a horror spring up in them, and convulse his whole features,
     which showed me that he knew me. He staggered back with a livid face,
     and I saw the perspiration break out upon his brow, while his teeth
     chattered in his head. At the sight, I leaned my back against the
     door and laughed loud and long. I had always known that vengeance
     would be sweet, but I had never hoped for the contentment of soul
     which now possessed me.

     "'You dog!' I said; 'I have hunted you from Salt Lake City to St.
     Petersburg, and you have always escaped me. Now, at last your
     wanderings have come to an end, for either you or I shall never see
     to-morrow's sun rise.' He shrunk still further away as I spoke, and I
     could see on his face that he thought I was mad. So I was for the
     time. The pulses in my temples beat like sledge-hammers, and I
     believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not
     gushed from my nose and relieved me.

     "'What do you think of Lucy Ferrier now?' I cried, locking the door,
     and shaking the key in his face. 'Punishment has been slow in coming,
     but it has overtaken you at last.' I saw his coward lips tremble as I
     spoke. He would have begged for his life, but he knew well that it
     was useless.

     "'Would you murder me?' he stammered.

     "'There is no murder,' I answered. 'Who talks of murdering a mad dog?
     What mercy had you upon my poor darling, when you dragged her from
     her slaughtered father, and bore her away to your accursed and
     shameless harem.'

     "'It was not I who killed her father,' he cried.

     "'But it was you who broke her innocent heart,' I shrieked, thrusting
     the box before him. 'Let the high God judge between us. Choose and
     eat. There is death in one and life in the other. I shall take what
     you leave. Let us see if there is justice upon the earth, or if we
     are ruled by chance.'

     "He cowered away with wild cries and prayers for mercy, but I drew my
     knife and held it to his throat until he had obeyed me. Then I
     swallowed the other, and we stood facing one another in silence for a
     minute or more, waiting to see which was to live and which was to
     die. Shall I ever forget the look which came over his face when the
     first warning pangs told him that the poison was in his system? I
     laughed as I saw it, and held Lucy's marriage ring in front of his
     eyes. It was but for a moment, for the action of the alkaloid is
     rapid. A spasm of pain contorted his features; he threw his hands out
     in front of him, staggered, and then, with a hoarse cry, fell heavily
     upon the floor. I turned him over with my foot, and placed my hand
     upon his heart. There was no movement. He was dead!

     "The blood had been streaming from my nose, but I had taken no notice
     of it. I don't know what it was that put it into my head to write
     upon the wall with it. Perhaps it was some mischievous idea of
     setting the police upon a wrong track, for I felt light-hearted and
     cheerful. I remembered a German being found in New York with RACHE
     written up above him, and it was argued at the time in the newspapers
     that the secret societies must have done it. I guessed that what
     puzzled the New Yorkers would puzzle the Londoners, so I dipped my
     finger in my own blood and printed it on a convenient place on the
     wall. Then I walked down to my cab and found that there was nobody

     "What did he do?"

     "He grazed his cattle on these slopes, and he learned to dig for tin
     when the bronze sword began to supersede the stone axe. Look at the
     great trench in the opposite hill. That is his mark. Yes, you will
     find some very singular points about the moor, Dr. Watson. Oh, excuse
     me an instant! It is surely Cyclopides."

     A small fly or moth had fluttered across our path, and in an instant
     Stapleton was rushing with extraordinary energy and speed in pursuit
     of it. To my dismay the creature flew straight for the great mire,
     and my acquaintance never paused for an instant, bounding from tuft
     to tuft behind it, his green net waving in the air. His gray clothes
     and jerky, zigzag, irregular progress made him not unlike some huge
     moth himself. I was standing watching his pursuit with a mixture of
     admiration for his extraordinary activity and fear lest he should
     lose his footing in the treacherous mire, when I heard the sound of
     steps, and turning round found a woman near me upon the path. She had
     come from the direction in which the plume of smoke indicated the
     position of Merripit House, but the dip of the moor had hid her until
     she was quite close.

     I could not doubt that this was the Miss Stapleton of whom I had been
     told, since ladies of any sort must be few upon the moor, and I
     remembered that I had heard someone describe her as being a beauty.
     The woman who approached me was certainly that, and of a most
     uncommon type. There could not have been a greater contrast between
     brother and sister, for Stapleton was neutral tinted, with light hair
     and gray eyes, while she was darker than any brunette whom I have
     seen in England--slim, elegant, and tall. She had a proud, finely cut
     face, so regular that it might have seemed impassive were it not for
     the sensitive mouth and the beautiful dark, eager eyes. With her
     perfect figure and elegant dress she was, indeed, a strange
     apparition upon a lonely moorland path. Her eyes were on her brother
     as I turned, and then she quickened her pace towards me. I had raised
     my hat and was about to make some explanatory remark, when her own
     words turned all my thoughts into a new channel.

     "Go back!" she said. "Go straight back to London, instantly."

     I could only stare at her in stupid surprise. Her eyes blazed at me,
     and she tapped the ground impatiently with her foot.

     "Why should I go back?" I asked.

     "I cannot explain." She spoke in a low, eager voice, with a curious
     lisp in her utterance. "But for God's sake do what I ask you. Go back
     and never set foot upon the moor again."

     "But I have only just come."

     "Man, man!" she cried. "Can you not tell when a warning is for your
     own good? Go back to London! Start to-night! Get away from this place
     at all costs! Hush, my brother is coming! Not a word of what I have
     said. Would you mind getting that orchid for me among the mares-tails
     yonder? We are very rich in orchids on the moor, though, of course,
     you are rather late to see the beauties of the place."

     Stapleton had abandoned the chase and came back to us breathing hard
     and flushed with his exertions.

     "Halloa, Beryl!" said he, and it seemed to me that the tone of his
     greeting was not altogether a cordial one.

     "Well, Jack, you are very hot."

     "Yes, I was chasing a Cyclopides. He is very rare and seldom found in
     the late autumn. What a pity that I should have missed him!" He spoke
     unconcernedly, but his small light eyes glanced incessantly from the
     girl to me.

     "You have introduced yourselves, I can see."

     "Very clearly. It is then the interest of the enemies of this
     lisp in her utterance. "But for God's sake do what I ask you. Go back
     and never set foot upon the moor again."

     "You have introduced yourselves, I can see."

     "Yes. I was telling Sir Henry that it was rather late for him to see
     the true beauties of the moor."

     "Why, who do you think this is?"

     "I imagine that it must be Sir Henry Baskerville."

     "No, no," said I. "Only a humble commoner, but his friend. My name is
     Dr. Watson."

     A flush of vexation passed over her expressive face. "We have been
     talking at cross purposes," said she.

     "Why, you had not very much time for talk," her brother remarked with
     the same questioning eyes.

     "I talked as if Dr. Watson were a resident instead of being merely a
     visitor," said she. "It cannot much matter to him whether it is early
     or late for the orchids. But you will come on, will you not, and see
     Merripit House?"

     A short walk brought us to it, a bleak moorland house, once the farm
     of some grazier in the old prosperous days, but now put into repair
     and turned into a modern dwelling. An orchard surrounded it, but the
     trees, as is usual upon the moor, were stunted and nipped, and the
     effect of the whole place was mean and melancholy. We were admitted
     by a strange, wizened, rusty-coated old manservant, who seemed in
     keeping with the house. Inside, however, there were large rooms
     furnished with an elegance in which I seemed to recognize the taste
     of the lady. As I looked from their windows at the interminable
     granite-flecked moor rolling unbroken to the farthest horizon I could
     not but marvel at what could have brought this highly educated man
     and this beautiful woman to live in such a place.

     "Queer spot to choose, is it not?" said he as if in answer to my
     thought. "And yet we manage to make ourselves fairly happy, do we
     not, Beryl?"

     "Quite happy," said she, but there was no ring of conviction in her
     words.

     "I had a school," said Stapleton. "It was in the north country. The
     work to a man of my temperament was mechanical and uninteresting, but
     the privilege of living with youth, of helping to mould those young
     minds, and of impressing them with one's own character and ideals,
     was very dear to me. However, the fates were against us. A serious
     epidemic broke out in the school and three of the boys died. It never
     recovered from the blow, and much of my capital was irretrievably
     swallowed up. And yet, if it were not for the loss of the charming
     companionship of the boys, I could rejoice over my own misfortune,
     for, with my strong tastes for botany and zoology, I find an
     unlimited field of work here, and my sister is as devoted to Nature
     as I am. All this, Dr. Watson, has been brought upon your head by
     your expression as you surveyed the moor out of our window."

     "It certainly did cross my mind that it might be a little dull--less
     for you, perhaps, than for your sister."

     "No, no, I am never dull," said she, quickly.

     "We have books, we have our studies, and we have interesting
     neighbours. Dr. Mortimer is a most learned man in his own line. Poor
     Sir Charles was also an admirable companion. We knew him well, and
     miss him more than I can tell. Do you think that I should intrude if
     I were to call this afternoon and make the acquaintance of Sir
     Henry?"

     "I am sure that he would be delighted."

     "Then perhaps you would mention that I propose to do so. We may in
     our humble way do something to make things more easy for him until he
     becomes accustomed to his new surroundings. Will you come upstairs,
     Dr. Watson, and inspect my collection of Lepidoptera? I think it is
     the most complete one in the south-west of England. By the time that
     you have looked through them lunch will be almost ready."

     But I was eager to get back to my charge. The melancholy of the moor,
     the death of the unfortunate pony, the weird sound which had been
     associated with the grim legend of the Baskervilles, all these things
     tinged my thoughts with sadness. Then on the top of these more or
     less vague impressions there had come the definite and distinct
     warning of Miss Stapleton, delivered with such intense earnestness
     that I could not doubt that some grave and deep reason lay behind it.
     I resisted all pressure to stay for lunch, and I set off at once upon
     my return journey, taking the grass-grown path by which we had come.

     It seems, however, that there must have been some short cut for those
     who knew it, for before I had reached the road I was astounded to see
     Miss Stapleton sitting upon a rock by the side of the track. Her face
     was beautifully flushed with her exertions, and she held her hand to
     her side.

     "I have run all the way in order to cut you off, Dr. Watson," said
     she. "I had not even time to put on my hat. I must not stop, or my
     brother may miss me. I wanted to say to you how sorry I am about the
     stupid mistake I made in thinking that you were Sir Henry. Please
     forget the words I said, which have no application whatever to you."

     "But I can't forget them, Miss Stapleton," said I. "I am Sir Henry's
     friend, and his welfare is a very close concern of mine. Tell me why
     it was that you were so eager that Sir Henry should return to
     London."

     "A woman's whim, Dr. Watson. When you know me better you will
     understand that I cannot always give reasons for what I say or do."

     "No, no. I remember the thrill in your voice. I remember the look in
     your eyes. Please, please, be frank with me, Miss Stapleton, for ever
     since I have been here I have been conscious of shadows all round me.
     Life has become like that great Grimpen Mire, with little green
     patches everywhere into which one may sink and with no guide to point
     the track. Tell me then what it was that you meant, and I will
     promise to convey your warning to Sir Henry."

     An expression of irresolution passed for an instant over her face,
     but her eyes had hardened again when she answered me.

     "You make too much of it, Dr. Watson," said she. "My brother and I
     were very much shocked by the death of Sir Charles. We knew him very
     intimately, for his favourite walk was over the moor to our house. He
     was deeply impressed with the curse which hung over the family, and
     when this tragedy came I naturally felt that there must be some
     grounds for the fears which he had expressed. I was distressed
     therefore when another member of the family came down to live here,
     and I felt that he should be warned of the danger which he will run.
     That was all which I intended to convey.

     "But what is the danger?"

     "You know the story of the hound?"

     "I do not believe in such nonsense."

     "But I do. If you have any influence with Sir Henry, take him away
     from a place which has always been fatal to his family. The world is
     wide. Why should he wish to live at the place of danger?"

     "Because it is the place of danger. That is Sir Henry's nature. I
     fear that unless you can give me some more definite information than
     this it would be impossible to get him to move."

     "I cannot say anything definite, for I do not know anything
     definite."

     "I would ask you one more question, Miss Stapleton. If you meant no
     more than this when you first spoke to me, why should you not wish
     your brother to overhear what you said? There is nothing to which he,
     or anyone else, could object."

     "My brother is very anxious to have the Hall inhabited, for he thinks
     it is for the good of the poor folk upon the moor. He would be very
     angry if he knew that I have said anything which might induce Sir
     Henry to go away. But I have done my duty now and I will say no more.
     I must get back, or he will miss me and suspect that I have seen you.
     Good-bye!" She turned and had disappeared in a few minutes among the
     scattered boulders, while I, with my soul full of vague fears,
     pursued my way to Baskerville Hall.





          CHAPTER VIII
          First Report of Dr. Watson


     From this point onward I will follow the course of events by
     transcribing my own letters to Mr. Sherlock Holmes which lie before
     me on the table. One page is missing, but otherwise they are exactly
     as written and show my feelings and suspicions of the moment more
     accurately than my memory, clear as it is upon these tragic events,
     can possibly do.

     Baskerville Hall, October 13th.

     My dear Holmes:
     My previous letters and telegrams have kept you pretty well up to
     date as to all that has occurred in this most God-forsaken corner of
     the world. The longer one stays here the more does the spirit of the
     moor sink into one's soul, its vastness, and also its grim charm.
     When you are once out upon its bosom you have left all traces of
     modern England behind you, but on the other hand you are conscious
     everywhere of the homes and the work of the prehistoric people. On
     all sides of you as you walk are the houses of these forgotten folk,
     with their graves and the huge monoliths which are supposed to have
     marked their temples. As you look at their gray stone huts against
     the scarred hill-sides you leave your own age behind you, and if you
     were to see a skin-clad, hairy man crawl out from the low door
     fitting a flint-tipped arrow on to the string of his bow, you would
     feel that his presence there was more natural than your own. The
     strange thing is that they should have lived so thickly on what must
     always have been most unfruitful soil. I am no antiquarian, but I
     could imagine that they were some unwarlike and harried race who were
     forced to accept that which none other would occupy.

     All this, however, is foreign to the mission on which you sent me and
     will probably be very uninteresting to your severely practical mind.
     I can still remember your complete indifference as to whether the sun
     moved round the earth or the earth round the sun. Let me, therefore,
     return to the facts concerning Sir Henry Baskerville.

     If you have not had any report within the last few days it is because
     up to to-day there was nothing of importance to relate. Then a very
     surprising circumstance occurred, which I shall tell you in due
     course. But, first of all, I must keep you in touch with some of the
     other factors in the situation.

     One of these, concerning which I have said little, is the escaped
     convict upon the moor. There is strong reason now to believe that he
     has got right away, which is a considerable relief to the lonely
     householders of this district. A fortnight has passed since his
     flight, during which he has not been seen and nothing has been heard
     of him. It is surely inconceivable that he could have held out upon
     the moor during all that time. Of course, so far as his concealment
     goes there is no difficulty at all. Any one of these stone huts would
     give him a hiding-place. But there is nothing to eat unless he were
     to catch and slaughter one of the moor sheep. We think, therefore,
     that he has gone, and the outlying farmers sleep the better in
     consequence.

     We are four able-bodied men in this household, so that we could take
     good care of ourselves, but I confess that I have had uneasy moments
     when I have thought of the Stapletons. They live miles from any help.
     There are one maid, an old manservant, the sister, and the brother,
     the latter not a very strong man. They would be helpless in the hands
     of a desperate fellow like this Notting Hill criminal, if he could
     once effect an entrance. Both Sir Henry and I were concerned at their
     situation, and it was suggested that Perkins the groom should go over
     to sleep there, but Stapleton would not hear of it.

     The fact is that our friend, the baronet, begins to display a
     considerable interest in our fair neighbour. It is not to be wondered
     at, for time hangs heavily in this lonely spot to an active man like
     him, and she is a very fascinating and beautiful woman. There is
     something tropical and exotic about her which forms a singular
     contrast to her cool and unemotional brother. Yet he also gives the
     idea of hidden fires. He has certainly a very marked influence over
     her, for I have seen her continually glance at him as she talked as
     if seeking approbation for what she said. I trust that he is kind to
     her. There is a dry glitter in his eyes, and a firm set of his thin
     lips, which goes with a positive and possibly a harsh nature. You
     would find him an interesting study.

     He came over to call upon Baskerville on that first day, and the very
     next morning he took us both to show us the spot where the legend of
     the wicked Hugo is supposed to have had its origin. It was an
     excursion of some miles across the moor to a place which is so dismal
     that it might have suggested the story. We found a short valley
     between rugged tors which led to an open, grassy space flecked over
     with the white cotton grass. In the middle of it rose two great
     stones, worn and sharpened at the upper end, until they looked like
     the huge corroding fangs of some monstrous beast. In every way it
     corresponded with the scene of the old tragedy. Sir Henry was much
     interested and asked Stapleton more than once whether he did really
     believe in the possibility of the interference of the supernatural in
     the affairs of men. He spoke lightly, but it was evident that he was
     very much in earnest. Stapleton was guarded in his replies, but it
     was easy to see that he said less than he might, and that he would
     not express his whole opinion out of consideration for the feelings
     of the baronet. He told us of similar cases, where families had
     suffered from some evil influence, and he left us with the impression
     that he shared the popular view upon the matter.

     On our way back we stayed for lunch at Merripit House, and it was
     there that Sir Henry made the acquaintance of Miss Stapleton. From
     the first moment that he saw her he appeared to be strongly attracted
     by her, and I am much mistaken if the feeling was not mutual. He
     referred to her again and again on our walk home, and since then
     hardly a day has passed that we have not seen something of the
     brother and sister. They dine here to-night, and there is some talk
     of our going to them next week. One would imagine that such a match
     would be very welcome to Stapleton, and yet I have more than once
     caught a look of the strongest disapprobation in his face when Sir
     Henry has been paying some attention to his sister. He is much
     attached to her, no doubt, and would lead a lonely life without her,
     but it would seem the height of selfishness if he were to stand in
     the way of her making so brilliant a marriage. Yet I am certain that
     he does not wish their intimacy to ripen into love, and I have
     several times observed that he has taken pains to prevent them from
     being tête-à-tête. By the way, your instructions to me never to allow
     Sir Henry to go out alone will become very much more onerous if a
     love affair were to be added to our other difficulties. My popularity
     would soon suffer if I were to carry out your orders to the letter.

     The other day--Thursday, to be more exact--Dr. Mortimer lunched with
     us. He has been excavating a barrow at Long Down, and has got a
     prehistoric skull which fills him with great joy. Never was there
     such a single-minded enthusiast as he! The Stapletons came in
     afterwards, and the good doctor took us all to the Yew Alley, at Sir
     Henry's request, to show us exactly how everything occurred upon that
     fatal night. It is a long, dismal walk, the Yew Alley, between two
     high walls of clipped hedge, with a narrow band of grass upon either
     side. At the far end is an old tumble-down summer-house. Half-way
     down is the moor-gate, where the old gentleman left his cigar-ash. It
     is a white wooden gate with a latch. Beyond it lies the wide moor. I
     remembered your theory of the affair and tried to picture all that
     had occurred. As the old man stood there he saw something coming
     across the moor, something which terrified him so that he lost his
     wits, and ran and ran until he died of sheer horror and exhaustion.
     There was the long, gloomy tunnel down which he fled. And from what?
     A sheep-dog of the moor? Or a spectral hound, black, silent, and
     monstrous? Was there a human agency in the matter? Did the pale,
     watchful Barrymore know more than he cared to say? It was all dim and
     vague, but always there is the dark shadow of crime behind it.

     One other neighbour I have met since I wrote last. This is Mr.
     Frankland, of Lafter Hall, who lives some four miles to the south of
     us. He is an elderly man, red-faced, white-haired, and choleric. His
     passion is for the British law, and he has spent a large fortune in
     litigation. He fights for the mere pleasure of fighting and is
     equally ready to take up either side of a question, so that it is no
     wonder that he has found it a costly amusement. Sometimes he will
     shut up a right of way and defy the parish to make him open it. At
     others he will with his own hands tear down some other man's gate and
     declare that a path has existed there from time immemorial, defying
     the owner to prosecute him for trespass. He is learned in old
     manorial and communal rights, and he applies his knowledge sometimes
     in favour of the villagers of Fernworthy and sometimes against them,
     so that he is periodically either carried in triumph down the village
     street or else burned in effigy, according to his latest exploit. He
     is said to have about seven lawsuits upon his hands at present, which
     will probably swallow up the remainder of his fortune and so draw his
     sting and leave him harmless for the future. Apart from the law he
     seems a kindly, good-natured person, and I only mention him because
     you were particular that I should send some description of the people
     who surround us. He is curiously employed at present, for, being an
     amateur astronomer, he has an excellent telescope, with which he lies
     upon the roof of his own house and sweeps the moor all day in the
     hope of catching a glimpse of the escaped convict. If he would
     confine his energies to this all would be well, but there are rumours
     that he intends to prosecute Dr. Mortimer for opening a grave without
     the consent of the next-of-kin, because he dug up the Neolithic skull
     in the barrow on Long Down. He helps to keep our lives from being
     monotonous and gives a little comic relief where it is badly needed.

     And now, having brought you up to date in the escaped convict, the
     Stapletons, Dr. Mortimer, and Frankland, of Lafter Hall, let me end
     on that which is most important and tell you more about the
     Barrymores, and especially about the surprising development of last
     night.

     First of all about the test telegram, which you sent from London in
     order to make sure that Barrymore was really here. I have already
     explained that the testimony of the postmaster shows that the test
     was worthless and that we have no proof one way or the other. I told
     Sir Henry how the matter stood, and he at once, in his downright
     fashion, had Barrymore up and asked him whether he had received the
     telegram himself. Barrymore said that he had.

     "Did the boy deliver it into your own hands?" asked Sir Henry.

     Barrymore looked surprised, and considered for a little time.

     "No," said he, "I was in the box-room at the time, and my wife
     brought it up to me."

     "Did you answer it yourself?"

     "No; I told my wife what to answer and she went down to write it."

     In the evening he recurred to the subject of his own accord.

     "I could not quite understand the object of your questions this
     morning, Sir Henry," said he. "I trust that they do not mean that I
     have done anything to forfeit your confidence?"

     Sir Henry had to assure him that it was not so and pacify him by
     giving him a considerable part of his old wardrobe, the London outfit
     having now all arrived.

     Mrs. Barrymore is of interest to me. She is a heavy, solid person,
     very limited, intensely respectable, and inclined to be puritanical.
     You could hardly conceive a less emotional subject. Yet I have told
     you how, on the first night here, I heard her sobbing bitterly, and
     since then I have more than once observed traces of tears upon her
     face. Some deep sorrow gnaws ever at her heart. Sometimes I wonder if
     she has a guilty memory which haunts her, and sometimes I suspect
     Barrymore of being a domestic tyrant. I have always felt that there
     was something singular and questionable in this man's character, but
     the adventure of last night brings all my suspicions to a head.

     And yet it may seem a small matter in itself. You are aware that I am
     not a very sound sleeper, and since I have been on guard in this
     house my slumbers have been lighter than ever. Last night, about two
     in the morning, I was aroused by a stealthy step passing my room. I
     rose, opened my door, and peeped out. A long black shadow was
     trailing down the corridor. It was thrown by a man who walked softly
     down the passage with a candle held in his hand. He was in shirt and
     trousers, with no covering to his feet. I could merely see the
     outline, but his height told me that it was Barrymore. He walked very
     slowly and circumspectly, and there was something indescribably
     guilty and furtive in his whole appearance.

     I have told you that the corridor is broken by the balcony which runs
     round the hall, but that it is resumed upon the farther side. I
     waited until he had passed out of sight and then I followed him. When
     I came round the balcony he had reached the end of the farther
     corridor, and I could see from the glimmer of light through an open
     door that he had entered one of the rooms. Now, all these rooms are
     unfurnished and unoccupied, so that his expedition became more
     mysterious than ever. The light shone steadily as if he were standing
     motionless. I crept down the passage as noiselessly as I could and
     peeped round the corner of the door.

     Barrymore was crouching at the window with the candle held against
     the glass. His profile was half turned towards me, and his face
     seemed to be rigid with expectation as he stared out into the
     blackness of the moor. For some minutes he stood watching intently.
     Then he gave a deep groan and with an impatient gesture he put out
     the light. Instantly I made my way back to my room, and very shortly
     came the stealthy steps passing once more upon their return journey.
     Long afterwards when I had fallen into a light sleep I heard a key
     turn somewhere in a lock, but I could not tell whence the sound came.
     What it all means I cannot guess, but there is some secret business
     going on in this house of gloom which sooner or later we shall get to
     the bottom of. I do not trouble you with my theories, for you asked
     me to furnish you only with facts. I have had a long talk with Sir
     Henry this morning, and we have made a plan of campaign founded upon
     my observations of last night. I will not speak about it just now,
     but it should make my next report interesting reading.


Iteration: 47000
     "We have an inspector who makes a specialty of Saffron Hill and the
     Italian quarter. Well, this dead man had some Catholic emblem round
     his neck, and that, along with his colour, made me think he was from
     the South. Inspector Hill knew him the moment he caught sight of him.
     His name is Pietro Venucci, from Naples, and he is one of the
     greatest cut-throats in London. He is connected with the Mafia,
     which, as you know, is a secret political society, enforcing its
     decrees by murder. Now you see how the affair begins to clear up. The
     other fellow is probably an Italian also, and a member of the Mafia.
     He has broken the rules in some fashion. Pietro is set upon his
     track. Probably the photograph we found in his pocket is the man
     himself, so that he may not knife the wrong person. He dogs the
     fellow, he sees him enter a house, he waits outside for him, and in
     the scuffle he receives his own death-wound. How is that, Mr.
     Sherlock Holmes?"

     Holmes clapped his hands approvingly.

     "Excellent, Lestrade, excellent!" he cried. "But I didn't quite
     follow your explanation of the destruction of the busts."

     "The busts! You never can get those busts out of your head. After
     all, that is nothing; petty larceny, six months at the most. It is
     the murder that we are really investigating, and I tell you that I am
     gathering all the threads into my hands."

     "And the next stage?"

     "Is a very simple one. I shall go down with Hill to the Italian
     quarter, find the man whose photograph we have got, and arrest him on
     the charge of murder. Will you come with us?"

     "I think not. I fancy we can attain our end in a simpler way. I can't
     say for certain, because it all depends--well, it all depends upon a
     factor which is completely outside our control. But I have great
     hopes--in fact, the betting is exactly two to one--that if you will
     come with us to-night I shall be able to help you to lay him by the
     heels."

     "In the Italian quarter?"

     "No; I fancy Chiswick is an address which is more likely to find him.
     If you will come with me to Chiswick to-night, Lestrade, I'll promise
     to go to the Italian quarter with you to-morrow, and no harm will be
     done by the delay. And now I think that a few hours' sleep would do
     us all good, for I do not propose to leave before eleven o'clock, and
     it is unlikely that we shall be back before morning. You'll dine with
     us, Lestrade, and then you are welcome to the sofa until it is time
     for us to start. In the meantime, Watson, I should be glad if you
     would ring for an express messenger, for I have a letter to send, and
     it is important that it should go at once."

     Holmes spent the evening in rummaging among the files of the old
     daily papers with which one of our lumber-rooms was packed. When at
     last he descended it was with triumph in his eyes, but he said
     nothing to either of us as to the result of his researches. For my
     own part, I had followed step by step the methods by which he had
     traced the various windings of this complex case, and, though I could
     not yet perceive the goal which we would reach, I understood clearly
     that Holmes expected this grotesque criminal to make an attempt upon
     the two remaining busts, one of which, I remembered, was at Chiswick.
     No doubt the object of our journey was to catch him in the very act,
     and I could not but admire the cunning with which my friend had
     inserted a wrong clue in the evening paper, so as to give the fellow
     the idea that he could continue his scheme with impunity. I was not
     surprised when Holmes suggested that I should take my revolver with
     me. He had himself picked up the loaded hunting-crop which was his
     favourite weapon.

     A four-wheeler was at the door at eleven, and in it we drove to a
     spot at the other side of Hammersmith Bridge. Here the cabman was
     directed to wait. A short walk brought us to a secluded road fringed
     with pleasant houses, each standing in its own grounds. In the light
     of a street lamp we read "Laburnum Villa" upon the gate-post of one
     of them. The occupants had evidently retired to rest, for all was
     dark save for a fanlight over the hall door, which shed a single
     blurred circle on to the garden path. The wooden fence which
     separated the grounds from the road threw a dense black shadow upon
     the inner side, and here it was that we crouched.

     "I fear that you'll have a long wait," Holmes whispered. "We may
     thank our stars that it is not raining. I don't think we can even
     venture to smoke to pass the time. However, it's a two to one chance
     that we get something to pay us for our trouble."

     It proved, however, that our vigil was not to be so long as Holmes
     had led us to fear, and it ended in a very sudden and singular
     fashion. In an instant, without the least sound to warn us of his
     coming, the garden gate swung open, and a lithe, dark figure, as
     swift and active as an ape, rushed up the garden path. We saw it
     whisk past the light thrown from over the door and disappear against
     the black shadow of the house. There was a long pause, during which
     we held our breath, and then a very gentle creaking sound came to our
     ears. The window was being opened. The noise ceased, and again there
     was a long silence. The fellow was making his way into the house. We
     saw the sudden flash of a dark lantern inside the room. What he
     sought was evidently not there, for again we saw the flash through
     another blind, and then through another.

     "Let us get to the open window. We will nab him as he climbs out,"
     Lestrade whispered.

     But before we could move the man had emerged again. As he came out
     into the glimmering patch of light we saw that he carried something
     white under his arm. He looked stealthily all round him. The silence
     of the deserted street reassured him. Turning his back upon us he
     laid down his burden, and the next instant there was the sound of a
     sharp tap, followed by a clatter and rattle. The man was so intent
     upon what he was doing that he never heard our steps as we stole
     across the grass plot. With the bound of a tiger Holmes was on his
     back, and an instant later Lestrade and I had him by either wrist and
     the handcuffs had been fastened. As we turned him over I saw a
     hideous, sallow face, with writhing, furious features, glaring up at
     us, and I knew that it was indeed the man of the photograph whom we
     had secured.

     But it was not our prisoner to whom Holmes was giving his attention.
     Squatted on the doorstep, he was engaged in most carefully examining
     that which the man had brought from the house. It was a bust of
     Napoleon like the one which we had seen that morning, and it had been
     broken into similar fragments. Carefully Holmes held each separate
     shard to the light, but in no way did it differ from any other
     shattered piece of plaster. He had just completed his examination
     when the hall lights flew up, the door opened, and the owner of the
     house, a jovial, rotund figure in shirt and trousers, presented
     himself.

     "Mr. Josiah Brown, I suppose?" said Holmes.

     "Yes, sir; and you, no doubt, are Mr. Sherlock Holmes? I had the note
     which you sent by the express messenger, and I did exactly what you
     told me. We locked every door on the inside and awaited developments.
     Well, I'm very glad to see that you have got the rascal. I hope,
     gentlemen, that you will come in and have some refreshment."

     However, Lestrade was anxious to get his man into safe quarters, so
     within a few minutes our cab had been summoned and we were all four
     upon our way to London. Not a word would our captive say; but he
     glared at us from the shadow of his matted hair, and once, when my
     hand seemed within his reach, he snapped at it like a hungry wolf. We
     stayed long enough at the police-station to learn that a search of
     his clothing revealed nothing save a few shillings and a long sheath
     knife, the handle of which bore copious traces of recent blood.

     "That's all right," said Lestrade, as we parted. "Hill knows all
     these gentry, and he will give a name to him. You'll find that my
     theory of the Mafia will work out all right. But I'm sure I am
     exceedingly obliged to you, Mr. Holmes, for the workmanlike way in
     which you laid hands upon him. I don't quite understand it all yet."

     "I fear it is rather too late an hour for explanations," said Holmes.
     "Besides, there are one or two details which are not finished off,
     and it is one of those cases which are worth working out to the very
     end. If you will come round once more to my rooms at six o'clock
     to-morrow I think I shall be able to show you that even now you have
     not grasped the entire meaning of this business, which presents some
     features which make it absolutely original in the history of crime.
     If ever I permit you to chronicle any more of my little problems,
     Watson, I foresee that you will enliven your pages by an account of
     the singular adventure of the Napoleonic busts."

     When we met again next evening Lestrade was furnished with much
     information concerning our prisoner. His name, it appeared, was
     Beppo, second name unknown. He was a well-known ne'er-do-well among
     the Italian colony. He had once been a skilful sculptor and had
     earned an honest living, but he had taken to evil courses and had
     twice already been in jail--once for a petty theft and once, as we
     had already heard, for stabbing a fellow-countryman. He could talk
     English perfectly well. His reasons for destroying the busts were
     still unknown, and he refused to answer any questions upon the
     subject; but the police had discovered that these same busts might
     very well have been made by his own hands, since he was engaged in
     this class of work at the establishment of Gelder & Co. To all this
     information, much of which we already knew, Holmes listened with
     polite attention; but I, who knew him so well, could clearly see that
     his thoughts were elsewhere, and I detected a mixture of mingled
     uneasiness and expectation beneath that mask which he was wont to
     assume. At last he started in his chair and his eyes brightened.
     There had been a ring at the bell. A minute later we heard steps upon
     the stairs, and an elderly, red-faced man with grizzled side-whiskers
     was ushered in. In his right hand he carried an old-fashioned
     carpet-bag, which he placed upon the table.

     "Is Mr. Sherlock Holmes here?"

     My friend bowed and smiled. "Mr. Sandeford, of Reading, I suppose?"
     said he.

     "Yes, sir, I fear that I am a little late; but the trains were
     awkward. You wrote to me about a bust that is in my possession."

     "Exactly."

     "I have your letter here. You said, 'I desire to possess a copy of
     Devine's Napoleon, and am prepared to pay you ten pounds for the one
     which is in your possession.' Is that right?"

     "Certainly."

     "I was very much surprised at your letter, for I could not imagine
     how you knew that I owned such a thing."

     "Of course you must have been surprised, but the explanation is very
     simple. Mr. Harding, of Harding Brothers, said that they had sold you
     their last copy, and he gave me your address."

     "Oh, that was it, was it? Did he tell you what I paid for it?"

     "No, he did not."

     "Well, I am an honest man, though not a very rich one. I only gave
     fifteen shillings for the bust, and I think you ought to know that
     before I take ten pounds from you."

     "I am sure the scruple does you honour, Mr. Sandeford. But I have
     named that price, so I intend to stick to it."

     "Well, it is very handsome of you, Mr. Holmes. I brought the bust up
     with me, as you asked me to do. Here it is!" He opened his bag, and
     at last we saw placed upon our table a complete specimen of that bust
     which we had already seen more than once in fragments.

     Holmes took a paper from his pocket and laid a ten-pound note upon
     the table.

     "You will kindly sign that paper, Mr. Sandeford, in the presence of
     these witnesses. It is simply to say that you transfer every possible
     right that you ever had in the bust to me. I am a methodical man, you
     see, and you never know what turn events might take afterwards. Thank
     you, Mr. Sandeford; here is your money, and I wish you a very good
     evening."

     When our visitor had disappeared Sherlock Holmes's movements were
     such as to rivet our attention. He began by taking a clean white
     cloth from a drawer and laying it over the table. Then he placed his
     newly-acquired bust in the centre of the cloth. Finally, he picked up
     his hunting-crop and struck Napoleon a sharp blow on the top of the
     head. The figure broke into fragments, and Holmes bent eagerly over
     the shattered remains. Next instant, with a loud shout of triumph, he
     held up one splinter, in which a round, dark object was fixed like a
     plum in a pudding.

     "Gentlemen," he cried, "let me introduce you to the famous black
     pearl of the Borgias."

     Lestrade and I sat silent for a moment, and then, with a spontaneous
     impulse, we both broke out clapping as at the well-wrought crisis of
     a play. A flush of colour sprang to Holmes's pale cheeks, and he
     bowed to us like the master dramatist who receives the homage of his
     audience. It was at such moments that for an instant he ceased to be
     a reasoning machine, and betrayed his human love for admiration and
     applause. The same singularly proud and reserved nature which turned
     away with disdain from popular notoriety was capable of being moved
     to its depths by spontaneous wonder and praise from a friend.

     "Yes, gentlemen," said he, "it is the most famous pearl now existing
     in the world, and it has been my good fortune, by a connected chain
     of inductive reasoning, to trace it from the Prince of Colonna's
     bedroom at the Dacre Hotel, where it was lost, to the interior of
     this, the last of the six busts of Napoleon which were manufactured
     by Gelder & Co., of Stepney. You will remember, Lestrade, the
     sensation caused by the disappearance of this valuable jewel, and the
     vain efforts of the London police to recover it. I was myself
     consulted upon the case; but I was unable to throw any light upon it.
     Suspicion fell upon the maid of the Princess, who was an Italian, and
     it was proved that she had a brother in London, but we failed to
     trace any connection between them. The maid's name was Lucretia
     Venucci, and there is no doubt in my mind that this Pietro who was
     murdered two nights ago was the brother. I have been looking up the
     dates in the old files of the paper, and I find that the
     disappearance of the pearl was exactly two days before the arrest of
     Beppo for some crime of violence, an event which took place in the
     factory of Gelder & Co., at the very moment when these busts were
     being made. Now you clearly see the sequence of events, though you
     see them, of course, in the inverse order to the way in which they
     presented themselves to me. Beppo had the pearl in his possession. He
     may have stolen it from Pietro, he may have been Pietro's
     confederate, he may have been the go-between of Pietro and his
     sister. It is of no consequence to us which is the correct solution.

     "The main fact is that he had the pearl, and at that moment, when it
     was on his person, he was pursued by the police. He made for the
     factory in which he worked, and he knew that he had only a few
     minutes in which to conceal this enormously valuable prize, which
     would otherwise be found on him when he was searched. Six plaster
     casts of Napoleon were drying in the passage. One of them was still
     soft. In an instant Beppo, a skilful workman, made a small hole in
     the wet plaster, dropped in the pearl, and with a few touches covered
     over the aperture once more. It was an admirable hiding-place. No one
     could possibly find it. But Beppo was condemned to a year's
     imprisonment, and in the meanwhile his six busts were scattered over
     London. He could not tell which contained his treasure. Only by
     breaking them could he see. Even shaking would tell him nothing, for
     as the plaster was wet it was probable that the pearl would adhere to
     it--as, in fact, it has done. Beppo did not despair, and he conducted
     his search with considerable ingenuity and perseverance. Through a
     cousin who works with Gelder he found out the retail firms who had
     bought the busts. He managed to find employment with Morse Hudson,
     and in that way tracked down three of them. The pearl was not there.
     Then, with the help of some Italian employe, he succeeded in finding
     out where the other three busts had gone. The first was at Harker's.
     There he was dogged by his confederate, who held Beppo responsible
     for the loss of the pearl, and he stabbed him in the scuffle which
     followed."

     "If he was his confederate why should he carry his photograph?" I
     asked.

     "As a means of tracing him if he wished to inquire about him from any
     third person. That was the obvious reason. Well, after the murder I
     calculated that Beppo would probably hurry rather than delay his
     movements. He would fear that the police would read his secret, and
     so he hastened on before they should get ahead of him. Of course, I
     could not say that he had not found the pearl in Harker's bust. I had
     not even concluded for certain that it was the pearl; but it was
     evident to me that he was looking for something, since he carried the
     bust past the other houses in order to break it in the garden which
     had a lamp overlooking it. Since Harker's bust was one in three the
     chances were exactly as I told you, two to one against the pearl
     being inside it. There remained two busts, and it was obvious that he
     would go for the London one first. I warned the inmates of the house,
     so as to avoid a second tragedy, and we went down with the happiest
     results. By that time, of course, I knew for certain that it was the
     Borgia pearl that we were after. The name of the murdered man linked
     the one event with the other. There only remained a single bust--the
     Reading one--and the pearl must be there. I bought it in your
     presence from the owner--and there it lies."

     We sat in silence for a moment.

     "Well," said Lestrade, "I've seen you handle a good many cases, Mr.
     Holmes, but I don't know that I ever knew a more workmanlike one than
     that. We're not jealous of you at Scotland Yard. No, sir, we are very
     proud of you, and if you come down to-morrow there's not a man, from
     the oldest inspector to the youngest constable, who wouldn't be glad
     to shake you by the hand."

     "Thank you!" said Holmes. "Thank you!" and as he turned away it
     seemed to me that he was more nearly moved by the softer human
     emotions than I had ever seen him. A moment later he was the cold and
     practical thinker once more. "Put the pearl in the safe, Watson,"
     said he, "and get out the papers of the Conk-Singleton forgery case.
     Good-bye, Lestrade. If any little problem comes your way I shall be
     happy, if I can, to give you a hint or two as to its solution."






                       THE ADVENTURE OF THE THREE STUDENTS

     It was in the year '95 that a combination of events, into which I
     need not enter, caused Mr. Sherlock Holmes and myself to spend some
     weeks in one of our great University towns, and it was during this
     time that the small but instructive adventure which I am about to
     relate befell us. It will be obvious that any details which would
     help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would
     be injudicious and offensive. So painful a scandal may well be
     allowed to die out. With due discretion the incident itself may,
     however, be described, since it serves to illustrate some of those
     qualities for which my friend was remarkable. I will endeavour in my
     statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to
     any particular place, or give a clue as to the people concerned.

     We were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library
     where Sherlock Holmes was pursuing some laborious researches in early
     English charters--researches which led to results so striking that
     they may be the subject of one of my future narratives. Here it was
     that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance, Mr. Hilton
     Soames, tutor and lecturer at the College of St. Luke's. Mr. Soames
     was a tall, spare man, of a nervous and excitable temperament. I had
     always known him to be restless in his manner, but on this particular
     occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it
     was clear something very unusual had occurred.

     "I trust, Mr. Holmes, that you can spare me a few hours of your
     valuable time. We have had a very painful incident at St. Luke's, and
     really, but for the happy chance of your being in the town, I should
     have been at a loss what to do."

     "I am very busy just now, and I desire no distractions," my friend
     answered. "I should much prefer that you called in the aid of the
     police."

     "No, no, my dear sir; such a course is utterly impossible. When once
     the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again, and this is just one of
     those cases where, for the credit of the college, it is most
     essential to avoid scandal. Your discretion is as well known as your
     powers, and you are the one man in the world who can help me. I beg
     you, Mr. Holmes, to do what you can."

     My friend's temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the
     congenial surroundings of Baker Street. Without his scrap-books, his
     chemicals, and his homely untidiness, he was an uncomfortable man. He
     shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence, while our visitor
     in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth
     his story.

     "I must explain to you, Mr. Holmes, that to-morrow is the first day
     of the examination for the Fortescue Scholarship. I am one of the
     examiners. My subject is Greek, and the first of the papers consists
     of a large passage of Greek translation which the candidate has not
     seen. This passage is printed on the examination paper, and it would
     naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it
     in advance. For this reason great care is taken to keep the paper
     secret.

     "To-day about three o'clock the proofs of this paper arrived from the
     printers. The exercise consists of half a chapter of Thucydides. I
     had to read it over carefully, as the text must be absolutely
     correct. At four-thirty my task was not yet completed. I had,
     however, promised to take tea in a friend's rooms, so I left the
     proof upon my desk. I was absent rather more than an hour.

     "You are aware, Mr. Holmes, that our college doors are double--a
     green baize one within and a heavy oak one without. As I approached
     my outer door I was amazed to see a key in it. For an instant I
     imagined that I had left my own there, but on feeling in my pocket I
     found that it was all right. The only duplicate which existed, so far
     as I knew, was that which belonged to my servant, Bannister, a man
     who has looked after my room for ten years, and whose honesty is
     absolutely above suspicion. I found that the key was indeed his, that
     he had entered my room to know if I wanted tea, and that he had very
     carelessly left the key in the door when he came out. His visit to my
     room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it. His
     forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other
     occasion, but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable
     consequences.

     "The moment I looked at my table I was aware that someone had
     rummaged among my papers. The proof was in three long slips. I had
     left them all together. Now, I found that one of them was lying on
     the floor, one was on the side table near the window, and the third
     was where I had left it."

     Holmes stirred for the first time.

     "'Can I get a train into town?'

     "The first page on the floor, the second in the window, the third
     where you left it," said he.

     "Exactly, Mr. Holmes. You amaze me. How could you possibly know
     that?"

     "Pray continue your very interesting statement."

     "For an instant I imagined that Bannister had taken the unpardonable
     liberty of examining my papers. He denied it, however, with the
     utmost earnestness, and I am convinced that he was speaking the
     truth. The alternative was that someone passing had observed the key
     in the door, had known that I was out, and had entered to look at the
     papers. A large sum of money is at stake, for the scholarship is a
     very valuable one, and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk
     in order to gain an advantage over his fellows.

     "Bannister was very much upset by the incident. He had nearly fainted
     when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with. I
     gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while I
     made a most careful examination of the room. I soon saw that the
     intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled
     papers. On the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil
     which had been sharpened. A broken tip of lead was lying there also.
     Evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry, had
     broken his pencil, and had been compelled to put a fresh point to
     it."

     "Excellent!" said Holmes, who was recovering his good-humour as his
     attention became more engrossed by the case. "Fortune has been your
     friend."

     "This was not all. I have a new writing-table with a fine surface of
     red leather. I am prepared to swear, and so is Bannister, that it was
     smooth and unstained. Now I found a clean cut in it about three
     inches long--not a mere scratch, but a positive cut. Not only this,
     but on the table I found a small ball of black dough, or clay, with
     specks of something which looks like sawdust in it. I am convinced
     that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers. There
     were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity. I was at
     my wits' ends, when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that
     you were in the town, and I came straight round to put the matter
     into your hands. Do help me, Mr. Holmes! You see my dilemma. Either I
     must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until
     fresh papers are prepared, and since this cannot be done without
     explanation there will ensue a hideous scandal, which will throw a
     cloud not only on the college, but on the University. Above all
     things I desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly."

     "I shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as I
     can," said Holmes, rising and putting on his overcoat. "The case is
     not entirely devoid of interest. Had anyone visited you in your room
     after the papers came to you?"

     "Yes; young Daulat Ras, an Indian student who lives on the same
     stair, came in to ask me some particulars about the examination."

     "For which he was entered?"

     "Yes."

Iteration: 48000
     "'"You're not going away in any kind of spirit, Hudson, I hope," said
     my father, with a tameness which mad my blood boil.

     "'"I've not had my 'pology," said he sulkily, glancing in my
     direction.

     "'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow
     rather roughly," said the dad, turning to me.

     "'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary
     patience towards him," I answered.

     "'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarls. "Very good, mate. We'll see about
     that!"

     "'He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the
     house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night
     after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was
     recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.'

     "'And how?' I asked eagerly.

     "'In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father
     yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father
     read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round
     the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his
     senses. When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and
     eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a
     stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once. We put him to bed; but the
     paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning
     consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.'

     "'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried. 'What then could have been in
     this letter to cause so dreadful a result?'

     "'Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was
     absurd and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!'

     "As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the
     fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we
     dashed up to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a
     gentleman in black emerged from it.

     "'When did it happen, doctor?' asked Trevor.

     "'Almost immediately after you left.'

     "'Did he recover consciousness?'

     "'For an instant before the end.'

     "'Any message for me?'

     "'Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese
     cabinet.'

     "My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I
     remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my
     head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was
     the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how
     had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?  Why,
     too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon
     his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingham? 
     Then I remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr.
     Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to
     blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The
     letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that
     he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it
     might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a
     betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how
     could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? 
     He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those
     ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean
     another. I must see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in
     it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat
     pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought
     in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but
     composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his
     grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the
     table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a
     single sheet of gray paper. 'The supply of game for London is going
     steadily up,' it ran. 'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now
     told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
     hen-pheasant's life.'

     "I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when
     first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was
     evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried
     in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a
     prearranged significance to such phrases as 'fly-paper' and
     'hen-pheasant'?  Such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be
     deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the
     case, and the presence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the
     subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from
     Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the
     combination 'life pheasant's hen' was not encouraging. Then I tried
     alternate words, but neither 'the of for' nor 'supply game London'
     promised to throw any light upon it.

     "And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I
     saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a
     message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.

     "It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my
     companion:

     "'The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.'

     "Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands, 'It must be
     that, I suppose,' said he. "This is worse than death, for it means
     disgrace as well. But what is the meaning of these "head-keepers" and
     "hen-pheasants"?

     "'It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to
     us if we had no other means of discovering the sender. You see that
     he has begun by writing "The ... game ... is," and so on. Afterwards
     he had, to fulfill the prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words
     in each space. He would naturally use the first words which came to
     his mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among
     them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or
     interested in breeding. Do you know anything of this Beddoes?'

     "'Why, now that you mention it,' said he, 'I remember that my poor
     father used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his
     preserves every autumn.'

     "'Then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes,' said I. 'It
     only remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor
     Hudson seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and
     respected men.'

     "'Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and shame!' cried my
     friend. 'But from you I shall have no secrets. Here is the statement
     which was drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from
     Hudson had become imminent. I found it in the Japanese cabinet, as he
     told the doctor. Take it and read it to me, for I have neither the
     strength nor the courage to do it myself.'

     "These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will
     read them to you, as I read them in the old study that night to him.
     They are endorsed outside, as you see, 'Some particulars of the
     voyage of the bark Gloria Scott, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th
     October, 1855, to her destruction in N. Lat. 15° 20', W. Long. 25°
     14' on Nov. 6th.' It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this
     way:

     "'My dear, dear son, now that approaching disgrace begins to darken
     the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty
     that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my
     position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have
     known me, which cuts me to the heart; but it is the thought that you
     should come to blush for me--you who love me and who have seldom, I
     hope, had reason to do other than respect me. But if the blow falls
     which is forever hanging over me, then I should wish you to read
     this, that you may know straight from me how far I have been to
     blame. On the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind God
     Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still
     undestroyed and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by all
     you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love
     which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give
     one thought to it again.

     "'If then your eye goes onto read this line, I know that I shall
     already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more
     likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue
     sealed forever in death. In either case the time for suppression is
     past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I
     swear as I hope for mercy.

     "'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my
     younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me
     a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which
     seemed to imply that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was
     that I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage I was
     convicted of breaking my country's laws, and was sentenced to
     transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
     transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
     debt of honor, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money which
     was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it
     before there could be any possibility of its being missed. But the
     most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had reckoned
     upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts
     exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with,
     but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than
     now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a
     felon with thirty-seven other convicts in 'tween-decks of the bark
     Gloria Scott, bound for Australia.

     "'It was the year '55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the
     old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black
     Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less
     suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. The Gloria Scott
     had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
     heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her
     out. She was a five-hundred-ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight
     jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a
     captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly
     a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from
     Falmouth.

     "'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being
     of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and
     frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had
     particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a young
     man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather
     nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a
     swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for
     his extraordinary height. I don't think any of our heads would have
     come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have
     measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many
     sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and
     resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I
     was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still
     when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear,
     and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which
     separated us.

     "'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here
     for?"

     "'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.

     "'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and by God! You'll learn to bless
     my name before you've done with me."

     "'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an
     immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own
     arrest. He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of
     incurably vicious habits, who had, by an ingenious system of fraud,
     obtained huge sums of money from the leading London merchants.

     "'"Ha, ha! You remember my case!" said he proudly.

     "'"Very well, indeed."

     "'"Then maybe you remember something queer about it?"

     "'"What was that, then?"

     "'"I'd had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn't I?"

     "'"So it was said."

     "'"But none was recovered, eh?"

     "'"No."

     "'"Well, where d'ye suppose the balance is?" he asked.

     "'"I have no idea," said I.

     "'"Right between my finger and thumb," he cried. "By God! I've got
     more pounds to my name than you've hairs on your head. And if you've
     money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do
     anything. Now, you don't think it likely that a man who could do
     anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking
     hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a Chin
     China coaster. No, sir, such a man will look after himself and will
     look after his chums. You may lay to that! You hold on to him, and
     you may kiss the book that he'll haul you through."

     "'That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant
     nothing; but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in
     with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really
     was a plot to gain command of the vessel. A dozen of the prisoners
     had hatched it before they came aboard, Prendergast was the leader,
     and his money was the motive power.

     "'"I'd a partner," said he, "a rare good man, as true as a stock to a
     barrel. He's got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at
     this moment?  Why, he's the chaplain of this ship--the chaplain, no
     less! He came aboard with a black coat, and his papers right, and
     money enough in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to
     main-truck. The crew are his, body and soul. He could buy 'em at so
     much a gross with a cash discount, and he did it before ever they
     signed on. He's got two of the warders and Mercer, the second mate,
     and he'd get the captain himself, if he thought him worth it."

     "'"What are we to do, then?" I asked.

     "'"What do you think?" said he. "We'll make the coats of some of
     these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did."

     "'"But they are armed," said I.

     "'"And so shall we be, my boy. There's a brace of pistols for every
     mother's son of us, and if we can't carry this ship, with the crew at
     our back, it's time we were all sent to a young misses'
     boarding-school. You speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and
     see if he is to be trusted."

     "'I did so, and found my other neighbor to be a young fellow in much
     the same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. His name
     was Evans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and he is now a
     rich and prosperous man in the south of England. He was ready enough
     to join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and
     before we had crossed the Bay there were only two of the prisoners
     who were not in the secret. One of these was of weak mind, and we did
     not dare to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice, and
     could not be of any use to us.

     "'From the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us from
     taking possession of the ship. The crew were a set of ruffians,
     specially picked for the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells
     to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts,
     and so often did he come that by the third day we had each stowed
     away at the foot of our beds a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of
     powder, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders were agents of
     Prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man. The captain,
     the two mates, two warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen soldiers,
     and the doctor were all that we had against us. Yet, safe as it was,
     we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack
     suddenly by night. It came, however, more quickly than we expected,
     and in this way.

     "'One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had
     come down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting his
     hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of the
     pistols. If he had been silent he might have blown the whole thing,
     but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and
     turned so pale that the man knew what was up in an instant and seized
     him. He was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon
     the bed. He had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were
     through it in a rush. The two sentries were shot down, and so was a
     corporal who came running to see what was the matter. There were two
     more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed
     not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot
     while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into the
     captain's cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an
     explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared over
     the chart of the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table, while the
     chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow. The
     two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business
     seemed to be settled.

     "'The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and
     flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just
     mad with the feeling that we were free once more. There were lockers
     all round, and Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and
     pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. We cracked off the necks of the
     bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing
     them off, when in an instant without warning there came the roar of
     muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we
     could not see across the table. When it cleared again the place was a
     shambles. Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each
     other on the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table
     turn me sick now when I think of it. We were so cowed by the sight
     that I think we should have given the job up if had not been for
     Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all
     that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the poop
     were the lieutenent and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the
     saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through
     the slit.  We got on them before they could load, and they stood to
     it like men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes
     it was all over. My God! Was there ever a slaughter-house like that
     ship! Predergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers
     up as if they had been children and threw them overboard alive or
     dead. There was one sergeant that was horribly wounded and yet kept
     on swimming for a surprising time, until some one in mercy blew out
     his brains. When the fighting was over there was no one left of our
     enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor.

     "'It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many of
     us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no
     wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the
     soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another
     to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. Eight of us,
     five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done.
     But there was no moving Predergast and those who were with him. Our
     only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and
     he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. It
     nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he
     said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. We jumped at the
     offer, for we were already sick of these blookthirsty doings, and we
     saw that there would be worse before it was done. We were given a
     suit of sailor togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk
     and one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw us over a
     chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had
     foundered in Lat. 15° and Long. 25° west, and then cut the painter
     and let us go.

     "'And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear
     son. The seamen had hauled the fore-yard aback during the rising, but
     now as we left them they brought it square again, and as there was a
     light wind from the north and east the bark began to draw slowly away
     from us. Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth
     rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated of the party,
     were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what
     coast we should make for. It was a nice question, for the Cape de
     Verds were about five hundred miles to the north of us, and the
     African coast about seven hundred to the east. On the whole, as the
     wind was coming round to the north, we thought that Sierra Leone
     might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the bark being
     at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as
     we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from
     her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. A few
     seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the
     smoke thinned away there was no sign left of the Gloria Scott. In an
     instant we swept the boat's head round again and pulled with all our
     strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the water
     marked the scene of this catastrophe.

     "'It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared
     that we had come too late to save any one. A splintered boat and a
     number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the
     waves showed us where the vessel had foundered; but there was no sign
     of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for
     help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying
     stretched across it. When we pulled him aboard the boat he proved to
     be a young seaman of the name of Hudson, who was so burned and
     exhausted that he could give us no account of what had happened until
     the following morning.

     "'It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had
     proceeded to put to death the five remaining prisoners. The two
     warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third
     mate. Prendergast then descended into the 'tween-decks and with his
     own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon. There only
     remained the first mate, who was a bold and active man. When he saw
     the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand he
     kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and
     rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. A dozen
     convicts, who descended with their pistols in search of him, found
     him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open powder-barrel,
     which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that he
     would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. An instant
     later the explosion occurred, though Hudson thought it was caused by
     the misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate's
     match. Be the cause what I may, it was the end of the Gloria Scott
     and of the rabble who held command of her.

     "'Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible
     business in which I was involved. Next day we were picked up by the
     brig Hotspur, bound for Australia, whose captain found no difficulty
     in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had
     foundered. The transport ship Gloria Scott was set down by the
     Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to
     her true fate. After an excellent voyage the Hotspur landed us at
     Sydney, where Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the
     diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all nations,
     we had no difficulty in losing our former identities. The rest I need
     not relate. We prospered, we traveled, we came back as rich colonials
     to England, and we bought country estates. For more than twenty years
     we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped that our past was
     forever buried. Imagine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who
     came to us I recognized instantly the man who had been picked off the
     wreck. He had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself to live
     upon our fears. You will understand now how it was that I strove to
     keep the peace with him, and you will in some measure sympathize with
     me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his
     other victim with threats upon his tongue.'

     "Underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible,
     'Beddoes writes in cipher to say H. has told all. Sweet Lord, have
     mercy on our souls!'

     "That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor, and
     I think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one.
     The good fellow was heart-broken at it, and went out to the Terai tea
     planting, where I hear that he is doing well. As to the sailor and
     Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on
     which the letter of warning was written. They both disappeared
     utterly and completely. No complaint had been lodged with the police,
     so that Beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had been
     seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had
     done away with Beddoes and had fled. For myself I believe that the
     truth was exactly the opposite. I think that it is most probable that
     Beddoes, pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been
     already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from
     the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. Those
     are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to your
     collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your service."






                               THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL

     An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend
     Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was
     the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he
     affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in
     his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a
     fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional
     in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan,
     coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made
     me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a
     limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the
     coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and
     his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the
     very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself
     virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should
     be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his
     queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a
     hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with
     a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither
     the atmosphere nor the appearance of our room was improved by it.


Iteration: 49000
     "'"You're not going away in any kind of spirit, Hudson, I hope," said
     my father, with a tameness which mad my blood boil.

     "'"I've not had my 'pology," said he sulkily, glancing in my
     direction.

     "'"Victor, you will acknowledge that you have used this worthy fellow
     rather roughly," said the dad, turning to me.

     "'"On the contrary, I think that we have both shown extraordinary
     patience towards him," I answered.

     "'"Oh, you do, do you?" he snarls. "Very good, mate. We'll see about
     that!"

     "'He slouched out of the room, and half an hour afterwards left the
     house, leaving my father in a state of pitiable nervousness. Night
     after night I heard him pacing his room, and it was just as he was
     recovering his confidence that the blow did at last fall.'

     "'And how?' I asked eagerly.

     "'In a most extraordinary fashion. A letter arrived for my father
     yesterday evening, bearing the Fordingbridge post-mark. My father
     read it, clapped both his hands to his head, and began running round
     the room in little circles like a man who has been driven out of his
     senses. When I at last drew him down on to the sofa, his mouth and
     eyelids were all puckered on one side, and I saw that he had a
     stroke. Dr. Fordham came over at once. We put him to bed; but the
     paralysis has spread, he has shown no sign of returning
     consciousness, and I think that we shall hardly find him alive.'

     "'You horrify me, Trevor!' I cried. 'What then could have been in
     this letter to cause so dreadful a result?'

     "'Nothing. There lies the inexplicable part of it. The message was
     absurd and trivial. Ah, my God, it is as I feared!'

     "As he spoke we came round the curve of the avenue, and saw in the
     fading light that every blind in the house had been drawn down. As we
     dashed up to the door, my friend's face convulsed with grief, a
     gentleman in black emerged from it.

     "'When did it happen, doctor?' asked Trevor.

     "'Almost immediately after you left.'

     "'Did he recover consciousness?'

     "'For an instant before the end.'

     "'Any message for me?'

     "'Only that the papers were in the back drawer of the Japanese
     cabinet.'

     "My friend ascended with the doctor to the chamber of death, while I
     remained in the study, turning the whole matter over and over in my
     head, and feeling as sombre as ever I had done in my life. What was
     the past of this Trevor, pugilist, traveler, and gold-digger, and how
     had he placed himself in the power of this acid-faced seaman?  Why,
     too, should he faint at an allusion to the half-effaced initials upon
     his arm, and die of fright when he had a letter from Fordingham? 
     Then I remembered that Fordingham was in Hampshire, and that this Mr.
     Beddoes, whom the seaman had gone to visit and presumably to
     blackmail, had also been mentioned as living in Hampshire. The
     letter, then, might either come from Hudson, the seaman, saying that
     he had betrayed the guilty secret which appeared to exist, or it
     might come from Beddoes, warning an old confederate that such a
     betrayal was imminent. So far it seemed clear enough. But then how
     could this letter be trivial and grotesque, as described by the son? 
     He must have misread it. If so, it must have been one of those
     ingenious secret codes which mean one thing while they seem to mean
     another. I must see this letter. If there were a hidden meaning in
     it, I was confident that I could pluck it forth. For an hour I sat
     pondering over it in the gloom, until at last a weeping maid brought
     in a lamp, and close at her heels came my friend Trevor, pale but
     composed, with these very papers which lie upon my knee held in his
     grasp. He sat down opposite to me, drew the lamp to the edge of the
     table, and handed me a short note scribbled, as you see, upon a
     single sheet of gray paper. 'The supply of game for London is going
     steadily up,' it ran. 'Head-keeper Hudson, we believe, has been now
     told to receive all orders for fly-paper and for preservation of your
     hen-pheasant's life.'

     "I dare say my face looked as bewildered as yours did just now when
     first I read this message. Then I reread it very carefully. It was
     evidently as I had thought, and some secret meaning must lie buried
     in this strange combination of words. Or could it be that there was a
     prearranged significance to such phrases as 'fly-paper' and
     'hen-pheasant'?  Such a meaning would be arbitrary and could not be
     deduced in any way. And yet I was loath to believe that this was the
     case, and the presence of the word Hudson seemed to show that the
     subject of the message was as I had guessed, and that it was from
     Beddoes rather than the sailor. I tried it backwards, but the
     combination 'life pheasant's hen' was not encouraging. Then I tried
     alternate words, but neither 'the of for' nor 'supply game London'
     promised to throw any light upon it.

     "And then in an instant the key of the riddle was in my hands, and I
     saw that every third word, beginning with the first, would give a
     message which might well drive old Trevor to despair.

     "It was short and terse, the warning, as I now read it to my
     companion:

     "'The game is up. Hudson has told all. Fly for your life.'

     "Victor Trevor sank his face into his shaking hands, 'It must be
     that, I suppose,' said he. "This is worse than death, for it means
     disgrace as well. But what is the meaning of these "head-keepers" and
     "hen-pheasants"?

     "'It means nothing to the message, but it might mean a good deal to
     us if we had no other means of discovering the sender. You see that
     he has begun by writing "The ... game ... is," and so on. Afterwards
     he had, to fulfill the prearranged cipher, to fill in any two words
     in each space. He would naturally use the first words which came to
     his mind, and if there were so many which referred to sport among
     them, you may be tolerably sure that he is either an ardent shot or
     interested in breeding. Do you know anything of this Beddoes?'

     "'Why, now that you mention it,' said he, 'I remember that my poor
     father used to have an invitation from him to shoot over his
     preserves every autumn.'

     "'Then it is undoubtedly from him that the note comes,' said I. 'It
     only remains for us to find out what this secret was which the sailor
     Hudson seems to have held over the heads of these two wealthy and
     respected men.'

     "'Alas, Holmes, I fear that it is one of sin and shame!' cried my
     friend. 'But from you I shall have no secrets. Here is the statement
     which was drawn up by my father when he knew that the danger from
     Hudson had become imminent. I found it in the Japanese cabinet, as he
     told the doctor. Take it and read it to me, for I have neither the
     strength nor the courage to do it myself.'

     "These are the very papers, Watson, which he handed to me, and I will
     read them to you, as I read them in the old study that night to him.
     They are endorsed outside, as you see, 'Some particulars of the
     voyage of the bark Gloria Scott, from her leaving Falmouth on the 8th
     October, 1855, to her destruction in N. Lat. 15° 20', W. Long. 25°
     14' on Nov. 6th.' It is in the form of a letter, and runs in this
     way:

     "'My dear, dear son, now that approaching disgrace begins to darken
     the closing years of my life, I can write with all truth and honesty
     that it is not the terror of the law, it is not the loss of my
     position in the county, nor is it my fall in the eyes of all who have
     known me, which cuts me to the heart; but it is the thought that you
     should come to blush for me--you who love me and who have seldom, I
     hope, had reason to do other than respect me. But if the blow falls
     which is forever hanging over me, then I should wish you to read
     this, that you may know straight from me how far I have been to
     blame. On the other hand, if all should go well (which may kind God
     Almighty grant!), then if by any chance this paper should be still
     undestroyed and should fall into your hands, I conjure you, by all
     you hold sacred, by the memory of your dear mother, and by the love
     which had been between us, to hurl it into the fire and to never give
     one thought to it again.

     "'If then your eye goes onto read this line, I know that I shall
     already have been exposed and dragged from my home, or as is more
     likely, for you know that my heart is weak, by lying with my tongue
     sealed forever in death. In either case the time for suppression is
     past, and every word which I tell you is the naked truth, and this I
     swear as I hope for mercy.

     "'My name, dear lad, is not Trevor. I was James Armitage in my
     younger days, and you can understand now the shock that it was to me
     a few weeks ago when your college friend addressed me in words which
     seemed to imply that he had surprised my secret. As Armitage it was
     that I entered a London banking-house, and as Armitage I was
     convicted of breaking my country's laws, and was sentenced to
     transportation. Do not think very harshly of me, laddie. It was a
     debt of honor, so called, which I had to pay, and I used money which
     was not my own to do it, in the certainty that I could replace it
     before there could be any possibility of its being missed. But the
     most dreadful ill-luck pursued me. The money which I had reckoned
     upon never came to hand, and a premature examination of accounts
     exposed my deficit. The case might have been dealt leniently with,
     but the laws were more harshly administered thirty years ago than
     now, and on my twenty-third birthday I found myself chained as a
     felon with thirty-seven other convicts in 'tween-decks of the bark
     Gloria Scott, bound for Australia.

     "'It was the year '55 when the Crimean war was at its height, and the
     old convict ships had been largely used as transports in the Black
     Sea. The government was compelled, therefore, to use smaller and less
     suitable vessels for sending out their prisoners. The Gloria Scott
     had been in the Chinese tea-trade, but she was an old-fashioned,
     heavy-bowed, broad-beamed craft, and the new clippers had cut her
     out. She was a five-hundred-ton boat; and besides her thirty-eight
     jail-birds, she carried twenty-six of a crew, eighteen soldiers, a
     captain, three mates, a doctor, a chaplain, and four warders. Nearly
     a hundred souls were in her, all told, when we set sail from
     Falmouth.

     "'The partitions between the cells of the convicts, instead of being
     of thick oak, as is usual in convict-ships, were quite thin and
     frail. The man next to me, upon the aft side, was one whom I had
     particularly noticed when we were led down the quay. He was a young
     man with a clear, hairless face, a long, thin nose, and rather
     nut-cracker jaws. He carried his head very jauntily in the air, had a
     swaggering style of walking, and was, above all else, remarkable for
     his extraordinary height. I don't think any of our heads would have
     come up to his shoulder, and I am sure that he could not have
     measured less than six and a half feet. It was strange among so many
     sad and weary faces to see one which was full of energy and
     resolution. The sight of it was to me like a fire in a snow-storm. I
     was glad, then, to find that he was my neighbor, and gladder still
     when, in the dead of the night, I heard a whisper close to my ear,
     and found that he had managed to cut an opening in the board which
     separated us.

     "'"Hullo, chummy!" said he, "what's your name, and what are you here
     for?"

     "'I answered him, and asked in turn who I was talking with.

     "'"I'm Jack Prendergast," said he, "and by God! You'll learn to bless
     my name before you've done with me."

     "'I remembered hearing of his case, for it was one which had made an
     immense sensation throughout the country some time before my own
     arrest. He was a man of good family and of great ability, but of
     incurably vicious habits, who had, by an ingenious system of fraud,
     obtained huge sums of money from the leading London merchants.

     "'"Ha, ha! You remember my case!" said he proudly.

     "'"Very well, indeed."

     "'"Then maybe you remember something queer about it?"

     "'"What was that, then?"

     "'"I'd had nearly a quarter of a million, hadn't I?"

     "'"So it was said."

     "'"But none was recovered, eh?"

     "'"No."

     "'"Well, where d'ye suppose the balance is?" he asked.

     "'"I have no idea," said I.

     "'"Right between my finger and thumb," he cried. "By God! I've got
     more pounds to my name than you've hairs on your head. And if you've
     money, my son, and know how to handle it and spread it, you can do
     anything. Now, you don't think it likely that a man who could do
     anything is going to wear his breeches out sitting in the stinking
     hold of a rat-gutted, beetle-ridden, mouldy old coffin of a Chin
     China coaster. No, sir, such a man will look after himself and will
     look after his chums. You may lay to that! You hold on to him, and
     you may kiss the book that he'll haul you through."

     "'That was his style of talk, and at first I thought it meant
     nothing; but after a while, when he had tested me and sworn me in
     with all possible solemnity, he let me understand that there really
     was a plot to gain command of the vessel. A dozen of the prisoners
     had hatched it before they came aboard, Prendergast was the leader,
     and his money was the motive power.

     "'"I'd a partner," said he, "a rare good man, as true as a stock to a
     barrel. He's got the dibbs, he has, and where do you think he is at
     this moment?  Why, he's the chaplain of this ship--the chaplain, no
     less! He came aboard with a black coat, and his papers right, and
     money enough in his box to buy the thing right up from keel to
     main-truck. The crew are his, body and soul. He could buy 'em at so
     much a gross with a cash discount, and he did it before ever they
     bear"--he gave a little stately cough--"had not I thought her to be
     self-sacrifice and that anything dishonourable would be repugnant to
     signed on. He's got two of the warders and Mercer, the second mate,
     and he'd get the captain himself, if he thought him worth it."

     "'"What are we to do, then?" I asked.

     "'"What do you think?" said he. "We'll make the coats of some of
     these soldiers redder than ever the tailor did."

     "'"But they are armed," said I.

     "'"And so shall we be, my boy. There's a brace of pistols for every
     mother's son of us, and if we can't carry this ship, with the crew at
     our back, it's time we were all sent to a young misses'
     boarding-school. You speak to your mate upon the left to-night, and
     see if he is to be trusted."

     "'I did so, and found my other neighbor to be a young fellow in much
     the same position as myself, whose crime had been forgery. His name
     was Evans, but he afterwards changed it, like myself, and he is now a
     rich and prosperous man in the south of England. He was ready enough
     to join the conspiracy, as the only means of saving ourselves, and
     before we had crossed the Bay there were only two of the prisoners
     who were not in the secret. One of these was of weak mind, and we did
     not dare to trust him, and the other was suffering from jaundice, and
     could not be of any use to us.

     "'From the beginning there was really nothing to prevent us from
     taking possession of the ship. The crew were a set of ruffians,
     specially picked for the job. The sham chaplain came into our cells
     to exhort us, carrying a black bag, supposed to be full of tracts,
     and so often did he come that by the third day we had each stowed
     away at the foot of our beds a file, a brace of pistols, a pound of
     powder, and twenty slugs. Two of the warders were agents of
     Prendergast, and the second mate was his right-hand man. The captain,
     the two mates, two warders Lieutenant Martin, his eighteen soldiers,
     and the doctor were all that we had against us. Yet, safe as it was,
     we determined to neglect no precaution, and to make our attack
     suddenly by night. It came, however, more quickly than we expected,
     and in this way.

     "'One evening, about the third week after our start, the doctor had
     come down to see one of the prisoners who was ill, and putting his
     hand down on the bottom of his bunk he felt the outline of the
     pistols. If he had been silent he might have blown the whole thing,
     but he was a nervous little chap, so he gave a cry of surprise and
     turned so pale that the man knew what was up in an instant and seized
     him. He was gagged before he could give the alarm, and tied down upon
     the bed. He had unlocked the door that led to the deck, and we were
     through it in a rush. The two sentries were shot down, and so was a
     corporal who came running to see what was the matter. There were two
     more soldiers at the door of the state-room, and their muskets seemed
     not to be loaded, for they never fired upon us, and they were shot
     while trying to fix their bayonets. Then we rushed on into the
     captain's cabin, but as we pushed open the door there was an
     explosion from within, and there he lay with his brains smeared over
     the chart of the Atlantic which was pinned upon the table, while the
     chaplain stood with a smoking pistol in his hand at his elbow. The
     two mates had both been seized by the crew, and the whole business
     seemed to be settled.

     "'The state-room was next the cabin, and we flocked in there and
     flopped down on the settees, all speaking together, for we were just
     mad with the feeling that we were free once more. There were lockers
     all round, and Wilson, the sham chaplain, knocked one of them in, and
     pulled out a dozen of brown sherry. We cracked off the necks of the
     bottles, poured the stuff out into tumblers, and were just tossing
     them off, when in an instant without warning there came the roar of
     muskets in our ears, and the saloon was so full of smoke that we
     could not see across the table. When it cleared again the place was a
     shambles. Wilson and eight others were wriggling on the top of each
     other on the floor, and the blood and the brown sherry on that table
     turn me sick now when I think of it. We were so cowed by the sight
     that I think we should have given the job up if had not been for
     Prendergast. He bellowed like a bull and rushed for the door with all
     that were left alive at his heels. Out we ran, and there on the poop
     were the lieutenent and ten of his men. The swing skylights above the
     saloon table had been a bit open, and they had fired on us through
     the slit.  We got on them before they could load, and they stood to
     it like men; but we had the upper hand of them, and in five minutes
     it was all over. My God! Was there ever a slaughter-house like that
     ship! Predergast was like a raging devil, and he picked the soldiers
     up as if they had been children and threw them overboard alive or
     dead. There was one sergeant that was horribly wounded and yet kept
     on swimming for a surprising time, until some one in mercy blew out
     his brains. When the fighting was over there was no one left of our
     enemies except just the warders, the mates, and the doctor.

     "'It was over them that the great quarrel arose. There were many of
     us who were glad enough to win back our freedom, and yet who had no
     wish to have murder on our souls. It was one thing to knock the
     soldiers over with their muskets in their hands, and it was another
     to stand by while men were being killed in cold blood. Eight of us,
     five convicts and three sailors, said that we would not see it done.
     But there was no moving Predergast and those who were with him. Our
     only chance of safety lay in making a clean job of it, said he, and
     he would not leave a tongue with power to wag in a witness-box. It
     nearly came to our sharing the fate of the prisoners, but at last he
     said that if we wished we might take a boat and go. We jumped at the
     offer, for we were already sick of these blookthirsty doings, and we
     saw that there would be worse before it was done. We were given a
     suit of sailor togs each, a barrel of water, two casks, one of junk
     and one of biscuits, and a compass. Prendergast threw us over a
     chart, told us that we were shipwrecked mariners whose ship had
     foundered in Lat. 15° and Long. 25° west, and then cut the painter
     and let us go.

     "'And now I come to the most surprising part of my story, my dear
     son. The seamen had hauled the fore-yard aback during the rising, but
     now as we left them they brought it square again, and as there was a
     light wind from the north and east the bark began to draw slowly away
     from us. Our boat lay, rising and falling, upon the long, smooth
     rollers, and Evans and I, who were the most educated of the party,
     were sitting in the sheets working out our position and planning what
     coast we should make for. It was a nice question, for the Cape de
     Verds were about five hundred miles to the north of us, and the
     African coast about seven hundred to the east. On the whole, as the
     wind was coming round to the north, we thought that Sierra Leone
     might be best, and turned our head in that direction, the bark being
     at that time nearly hull down on our starboard quarter. Suddenly as
     we looked at her we saw a dense black cloud of smoke shoot up from
     her, which hung like a monstrous tree upon the sky line. A few
     seconds later a roar like thunder burst upon our ears, and as the
     smoke thinned away there was no sign left of the Gloria Scott. In an
     instant we swept the boat's head round again and pulled with all our
     strength for the place where the haze still trailing over the water
     marked the scene of this catastrophe.

     "'It was a long hour before we reached it, and at first we feared
     that we had come too late to save any one. A splintered boat and a
     number of crates and fragments of spars rising and falling on the
     waves showed us where the vessel had foundered; but there was no sign
     of life, and we had turned away in despair when we heard a cry for
     help, and saw at some distance a piece of wreckage with a man lying
     stretched across it. When we pulled him aboard the boat he proved to
     be a young seaman of the name of Hudson, who was so burned and
     exhausted that he could give us no account of what had happened until
     the following morning.

     "'It seemed that after we had left, Prendergast and his gang had
     proceeded to put to death the five remaining prisoners. The two
     warders had been shot and thrown overboard, and so also had the third
     mate. Prendergast then descended into the 'tween-decks and with his
     own hands cut the throat of the unfortunate surgeon. There only
     remained the first mate, who was a bold and active man. When he saw
     the convict approaching him with the bloody knife in his hand he
     kicked off his bonds, which he had somehow contrived to loosen, and
     rushing down the deck he plunged into the after-hold. A dozen
     convicts, who descended with their pistols in search of him, found
     him with a match-box in his hand seated beside an open powder-barrel,
     which was one of a hundred carried on board, and swearing that he
     would blow all hands up if he were in any way molested. An instant
     later the explosion occurred, though Hudson thought it was caused by
     the misdirected bullet of one of the convicts rather than the mate's
     match. Be the cause what I may, it was the end of the Gloria Scott
     and of the rabble who held command of her.

     "'Such, in a few words, my dear boy, is the history of this terrible
     business in which I was involved. Next day we were picked up by the
     brig Hotspur, bound for Australia, whose captain found no difficulty
     in believing that we were the survivors of a passenger ship which had
     foundered. The transport ship Gloria Scott was set down by the
     Admiralty as being lost at sea, and no word has ever leaked out as to
     her true fate. After an excellent voyage the Hotspur landed us at
     Sydney, where Evans and I changed our names and made our way to the
     diggings, where, among the crowds who were gathered from all nations,
     we had no difficulty in losing our former identities. The rest I need
     not relate. We prospered, we traveled, we came back as rich colonials
     to England, and we bought country estates. For more than twenty years
     we have led peaceful and useful lives, and we hoped that our past was
     forever buried. Imagine, then, my feelings when in the seaman who
     came to us I recognized instantly the man who had been picked off the
     wreck. He had tracked us down somehow, and had set himself to live
     upon our fears. You will understand now how it was that I strove to
     keep the peace with him, and you will in some measure sympathize with
     me in the fears which fill me, now that he has gone from me to his
     other victim with threats upon his tongue.'

     "Underneath is written in a hand so shaky as to be hardly legible,
     'Beddoes writes in cipher to say H. has told all. Sweet Lord, have
     mercy on our souls!'

     "That was the narrative which I read that night to young Trevor, and
     I think, Watson, that under the circumstances it was a dramatic one.
     The good fellow was heart-broken at it, and went out to the Terai tea
     planting, where I hear that he is doing well. As to the sailor and
     Beddoes, neither of them was ever heard of again after that day on
     which the letter of warning was written. They both disappeared
     utterly and completely. No complaint had been lodged with the police,
     so that Beddoes had mistaken a threat for a deed. Hudson had been
     seen lurking about, and it was believed by the police that he had
     done away with Beddoes and had fled. For myself I believe that the
     truth was exactly the opposite. I think that it is most probable that
     Beddoes, pushed to desperation and believing himself to have been
     already betrayed, had revenged himself upon Hudson, and had fled from
     the country with as much money as he could lay his hands on. Those
     are the facts of the case, Doctor, and if they are of any use to your
     collection, I am sure that they are very heartily at your service."







                               THE MUSGRAVE RITUAL

     An anomaly which often struck me in the character of my friend
     Sherlock Holmes was that, although in his methods of thought he was
     the neatest and most methodical of mankind, and although also he
     affected a certain quiet primness of dress, he was none the less in
     his personal habits one of the most untidy men that ever drove a
     fellow-lodger to distraction. Not that I am in the least conventional
     in that respect myself. The rough-and-tumble work in Afghanistan,
     coming on the top of a natural Bohemianism of disposition, has made
     me rather more lax than befits a medical man. But with me there is a
     limit, and when I find a man who keeps his cigars in the
     coal-scuttle, his tobacco in the toe end of a Persian slipper, and
     his unanswered correspondence transfixed by a jack-knife into the
     very centre of his wooden mantelpiece, then I begin to give myself
     virtuous airs. I have always held, too, that pistol practice should
     be distinctly an open-air pastime; and when Holmes, in one of his
     queer humors, would sit in an arm-chair with his hair-trigger and a
     hundred Boxer cartridges, and proceed to adorn the opposite wall with
     a patriotic V. R. done in bullet-pocks, I felt strongly that neither
